Scrapy is a framework for web scraping and crawling in Python used for extracting, processing and storing web data. We have explored it in our project for two use cases.It is basically a framework for web crawling that crawls the specified domain with a ‘spider’. A spider is self-contained with a set of instructions and can crawl a given domain or a set of URLs to extract content.
i. To extract content from an entire website or domain
ii. To get the main text from a webpage.
