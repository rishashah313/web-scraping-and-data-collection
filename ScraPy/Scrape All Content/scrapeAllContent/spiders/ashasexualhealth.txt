ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

Search this websiteHealth Policy
Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.
HIV Testing Day 2019
June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.
Herpes Diagnosis and Management: A Two-Part Conversation with Terri Warren, ANP
In this two-part episode, Terri Warren, ANP—nurse, author, and owner of Westover Heights Clinic in Portland, Oregon that specializes in the genital herpes infection—explains the tests that can provide an accurate genital herpes diagnosis and how they work and clarifies that a physical exam alone should never be the final diagnosis for anyone, for many reasons. She also discusses the importance of knowing herpes type and offers helpful insight into how to put a herpes infection into proper perspective.
Sexual Pleasure beyond the Big “O”
A conversation with sexuality and relationship expert Dr. Logan Levkoff
March 9, 2018

Listen in as Dr. Levkoff dishes on everything from not only having more sex but better sex, and why sexual pleasure doesn’t need to involve a partner!
Chronic Pelvic Pain in Women
February 23,2018
Beyond the physical discomfort they experience, women with chronic pelvic pain often have to navigate choppy waters emotionally and in their relationships. Dr. Karen Tang with the Gynecology Specialists of Philadelphia practice joins us to talk about the many possible causes of chronic pelvic pain and approaches to treatment.

In this episode we chat about current therapies for cervical cancer, take a glimpse into the pipeline to see what’s being developed and finish with a discussion on the crucial role of clinical trials in expanding our treatment arsenal.
Proposed Changes to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
December 28, 2017
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published a draft of updated cervical cancer screening guidelines and some big changes are proposed. For insight on why check-ups for cervical cancer continue to change and move away from the traditional annual Pap, in this episode, we chat with Mark H. Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair of OB/GYN and Women’s Health at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
A Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties
December 27, 2017
Female sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom. When sex isn’t easy how do you even begin this conversation with your partner or, for that matter, your healthcare provider? Sociologist, sexologist and relationship expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz joins our Sex+Health podcast for a three-part discussion on the range of female sexual difficulties and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners).

Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,
Lynn Barclay
ASHA President and CEO
Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.
Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.
How do I sign up?
Follow this link and create an account. Or sign up below! We are excited for you to join us!

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Search this websiteWho We Are
ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.
ASHA Milestones

1940: ASHA, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the military agree to coordinate efforts to control venereal diseases in the event of war.
1945: Boxer Joe Louis joins ASHA for a major public awareness campaign.
1954: ASHA begins to monitor rates of venereal disease by collecting data that was then analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “Today’s VD Control Problem” published by ASHA until 1975. ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.
1959: ASHA changes its name to the American Social Health Association.
1970s: Dramatic rise in sexually transmitted infection rates because of international travel, the sexual revolution, gay liberation and increasing drug use. Scientists recognizing more and more sexually transmitted pathogens. Genital herpes, human Papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B identified.

ASHA Today
ASHA specializes in communications outreach to the public, patients, press, providers, and policy makers by developing and delivering sensitive health information through many vehicles such as our websites, ashasexualhealth.org, iwannaknow.org (for teens and young adults), quierosaber.org (in Spanish), and nccc-online.org (site of the ASHA program, National Cervical Cancer Coalition).
Public and college health clinics across the United States order ASHA’s educational pamphlets and books to give to clients and students. Community-based organizations depend on ASHA, too, to help communicate about sexual health information.

Search this websiteSexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,
Lynn Barclay

Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.
HIV Testing Day 2019
June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.
Herpes Diagnosis and Management: A Two-Part Conversation with Terri Warren, ANP
In this two-part episode, Terri Warren, ANP—nurse, author, and owner of Westover Heights Clinic in Portland, Oregon that specializes in the genital herpes infection—explains the tests that can provide an accurate genital herpes diagnosis and how they work and clarifies that a physical exam alone should never be the final diagnosis for anyone, for many reasons. She also discusses the importance of knowing herpes type and offers helpful insight into how to put a herpes infection into proper perspective.
Sexual Pleasure beyond the Big “O”
A conversation with sexuality and relationship expert Dr. Logan Levkoff
March 9, 2018

Whether alone or with a partner, sexual pleasure is good for you! Listen in as Dr. Levkoff dishes on everything from not only having more sex but better sex, and why sexual pleasure doesn’t need to involve a partner!
Chronic Pelvic Pain in Women
February 23,2018
Beyond the physical discomfort they experience, women with chronic pelvic pain often have to navigate choppy waters emotionally and in their relationships. Dr. Karen Tang with the Gynecology Specialists of Philadelphia practice joins us to talk about the many possible causes of chronic pelvic pain and approaches to treatment. She offers practical advice not only for women but their partners, too. Visit http://philadelphiagyn.com/ for patient education resources including videos with Dr. Tang.
Treat Me Right: The Continued Evolution of Therapies for Cervical Cancer
January 26, 2018
The development of new treatment options for cervical cancer has been frustratingly slow but Dr. Kathleen Moore of the University of Oklahoma’s Stephenson Cancer Center says that may finally be changing. In this episode we chat about current therapies for cervical cancer, take a glimpse into the pipeline to see what’s being developed and finish with a discussion on the crucial role of clinical trials in expanding our treatment arsenal.
Proposed Changes to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
December 28, 2017
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published a draft of updated cervical cancer screening guidelines and some big changes are proposed. For insight on why check-ups for cervical cancer continue to change and move away from the traditional annual Pap, in this episode, we chat with Mark H. Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair of OB/GYN and Women’s Health at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
A Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties
December 27, 2017
Female sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom. When sex isn’t easy how do you even begin this conversation with your partner or, for that matter, your healthcare provider?

World Sexual Health Day
September 8, 2017
In this episode, Dr. Eli Coleman, director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota and a former member of ASHA’s board of directors, talks about developing a broader view of sexual health that goes beyond merely having sex with another person.
Men’s Health Month 2017
July 17, 2017
We ruminate on men and sexual health in this episode with Dr. Abe Morgentaler of Men’s Health Boston and ASHA’s vice president for strategic partnerships Kay Phillips. Both offer their insights and we highlight the tools and resources ASHA offers for men (and organizations serving them).
Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.
ASHA Milestones

1945: Boxer Joe Louis joins ASHA for a major public awareness campaign.
1954: ASHA begins to monitor rates of venereal disease by collecting data that was then analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “Today’s VD Control Problem” published by ASHA until 1975. ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.
1959: ASHA changes its name to the American Social Health Association.

ASHA Today
ASHA specializes in communications outreach to the public, patients, press, providers, and policy makers by developing and delivering sensitive health information through many vehicles such as our websites, ashasexualhealth.org, iwannaknow.org (for teens and young adults), quierosaber.org (in Spanish), and nccc-online.org (site of the ASHA program, National Cervical Cancer Coalition).

Search this websiteSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.
HIV Testing Day 2019
June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.

Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,
Lynn Barclay

Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.
Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

Search this websiteWho We Are
ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.
1959: ASHA changes its name to the American Social Health Association.

Search this websiteHepatitis B Virus: Five Things to Know
Hepatitis B is a virus that causes inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be experienced as an “acute” infection causing mild illness for a few weeks or months or as a more serious “chronic” infection lasting a lifetime. Chronic HBV infection can cause complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and even lead to liver cancer.
Hepatitis B is More Common Than You Think
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates as many as 2.2 million persons in the U.S. are living with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis B Is Most Commonly Transmitted Through Sexual Contact
Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, and blood. HBV is most often transmitted through sexual contact but can also be contracted when injecting drug users share needles and other injecting equipment. Mothers with HBV can also pass the virus to their infants during birth.
But Most Don’t Know They Have It
Adults often have few – if any- symptoms. When they occur, symptoms can be mistaken for the flu (nausea and vomiting, malaise, loss of appetite and abdominal pain). Some people with hepatitis B also experience jaundice, a yellowing of the eyes or skin.
The Only Way to Know is to Get Tested
The only way to know for sure is to test! Ask your health care provider if a test for HBV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are right for you. Special blood tests are used that can detect either HBV particles or antibodies (proteins in the blood your body produces against infections). Blood tests can determine if someone with hepatitis B has an acute or chronic infection.
It’s Easy to Prevent
Use male or female condoms (sometimes called external or internal condoms) each time you have sex. While they don’t provide 100% protection against hepatitis B and other STIs, when used consistently and correctly condoms are one of the best ways to reduce your risk for hepatitis B and other STIs. Those sharing households with someone diagnosed with HBV should contact with infected blood or other body fluids directly or on objects such as needles, razors, toothbrushes, and the like. Clean surfaces contaminated with blood or other body fluids with a solution of 1 part household bleach and 10 parts water.
There is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B! CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccination for sex partners of anyone who has hepatitis B; anyone who is sexually active but not in a long-term, monogamous relationship; those treated for STD/STIs; and men who have sex with men. Others may benefit from vaccination against HBV so ask your health care provider what is recommended for you.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.
HIV Testing Day 2019
June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.
Herpes Diagnosis and Management: A Two-Part Conversation with Terri Warren, ANP
In this two-part episode, Terri Warren, ANP—nurse, author, and owner of Westover Heights Clinic in Portland, Oregon that specializes in the genital herpes infection—explains the tests that can provide an accurate genital herpes diagnosis and how they work and clarifies that a physical exam alone should never be the final diagnosis for anyone, for many reasons. She also discusses the importance of knowing herpes type and offers helpful insight into how to put a herpes infection into proper perspective.
Sexual Pleasure beyond the Big “O”
A conversation with sexuality and relationship expert Dr. Logan Levkoff
March 9, 2018

Chronic Pelvic Pain in Women
February 23,2018
Beyond the physical discomfort they experience, women with chronic pelvic pain often have to navigate choppy waters emotionally and in their relationships. Dr. Karen Tang with the Gynecology Specialists of Philadelphia practice joins us to talk about the many possible causes of chronic pelvic pain and approaches to treatment.

The development of new treatment options for cervical cancer has been frustratingly slow but Dr. Kathleen Moore of the University of Oklahoma’s Stephenson Cancer Center says that may finally be changing. In this episode we chat about current therapies for cervical cancer, take a glimpse into the pipeline to see what’s being developed and finish with a discussion on the crucial role of clinical trials in expanding our treatment arsenal.
Proposed Changes to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
December 28, 2017
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published a draft of updated cervical cancer screening guidelines and some big changes are proposed. For insight on why check-ups for cervical cancer continue to change and move away from the traditional annual Pap, in this episode, we chat with Mark H. Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair of OB/GYN and Women’s Health at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
A Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties
December 27, 2017
Female sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom.

Men’s Health Month 2017
July 17, 2017
We ruminate on men and sexual health in this episode with Dr. Abe Morgentaler of Men’s Health Boston and ASHA’s vice president for strategic partnerships Kay Phillips. Both offer their insights and we highlight the tools and resources ASHA offers for men (and organizations serving them).
Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.
Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.

June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.

Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair of OB/GYN and Women’s Health at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
A Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties
December 27, 2017
Female sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom. When sex isn’t easy how do you even begin this conversation with your partner or, for that matter, your healthcare provider? Sociologist, sexologist and relationship expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz joins our Sex+Health podcast for a three-part discussion on the range of female sexual difficulties and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You’re not alone! NOTE: the findmyspark.com website mentioned in these episodes is currently unavailable so for information on females sexual difficulties visit ASHA’s pages on women’s health. We also offer a patient education resource ASHA developed in collaboration with WebMD Education, Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause.
Episode One: How do female sexual difficulties (FSD) affect relationships in and out of the bedroom?
Episode Two: Concerned your partner is no longer in the mood? It may be more than you think.
Episode Three: Diving deeper into the most common female sexual difficulty (FSD), Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), and the other types of FSD that may be affecting your relationship.
Gynecological Health Awareness Month
September 8, 2017

Mamta Singhvi, MD, a radiation oncologist and ASHA board member, discusses various ways gynecologic cancers are treated, what to expect during and following treatment and issues around prevention and early detection.
World Sexual Health Day
September 8, 2017

Men’s Health Month 2017
July 17, 2017
We ruminate on men and sexual health in this episode with Dr. Abe Morgentaler of Men’s Health Boston and ASHA’s vice president for strategic partnerships Kay Phillips. Both offer their insights and we highlight the tools and resources ASHA offers for men (and organizations serving them).
Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.
Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

1945: Boxer Joe Louis joins ASHA for a major public awareness campaign.
1954: ASHA begins to monitor rates of venereal disease by collecting data that was then analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “Today’s VD Control Problem” published by ASHA until 1975. ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.
1959: ASHA changes its name to the American Social Health Association.
1970s: Dramatic rise in sexually transmitted infection rates because of international travel, the sexual revolution, gay liberation and increasing drug use. Scientists recognizing more and more sexually transmitted pathogens. Genital herpes, human Papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B identified.

Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.

Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Ambassadors are willing to start conversations about taboo topics and are passionate about creating a sexually healthy nation. They use social media as a platform for sharing important sexual health information. Want to see what ASHA ambassadors are doing? Check out the hashtag #ISpeakSexHealth across all Social Media Platforms!
If you want to play a vital role in creating a sexually healthy nation then ASHA’s Volunteer Ambassador Program is the place for you. Volunteering as an ambassador is super easy but is an extremely important component of ASHA. Twice a week, ASHA Ambassadors are sent content that they can choose to share onto their own social media platforms. This allows ASHA to expand our audience by getting sexual health information out into a variety of social networks that may otherwise never receive it! In addition, we periodically have other opportunities for people to get more involved in the work that ASHA is doing.

Health policy—laws, regulations, and guidelines—help shape public health and have a significant impact on our lives. From seat belt laws, to regulations on tobacco use, to vaccine recommendations, health policy can improve public health, prevent disease and contribute to a healthier society.
ASHA’s focus is on policies related to sexual health, which can include everything from improved access to contraception and family planning services, support for comprehensive sex education, protection for LGBTQ individuals, and promotion of vaccine and screening recommendations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Such policies have an impact on our daily lives as well as on broader public health outcomes.
For example, look at the case of legalized same-sex marriage. While often viewed through the lens of politics, the issue is more a matter of public health. Research has shown that legal marriage comes with not just social and economic benefits, but significant positive health benefits as well, including better access to health insurance and care as well as reduced rates of anxiety and depression. Additionally, surveys of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed evidence of the negative health effects of marriage inequality.
The goal of our policy efforts is to improve access to sexual health services and help people achieve good sexual health throughout their lives. As the oldest nonprofit organization in the underserved area of STIs, ASHA plays a leading role in advocating for sound sexual health policy in Washington, DC. We work in coalitions with important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities.
For example, ASHA’s policy efforts include support of:
Appropriate federal funding for STD prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Comprehensive sex education and improving sex education practices and policy, such as LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed.
Improved research and policies on cancer screening and prevention.
Selected Issues in Sexual Health Policy
Ensuring Access to Services for Young People
ASHA supports the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act (YASHS Act), legislation first introduced in 2016 that would provide grants to increase and improve the linkage and access of marginalized young people to sexual and reproductive health care and related services.
Funding for HIV Prevention, Treatment and Support Programs
As part of the AIDS Budget and Appropriations Coalition (ABAC), a work group of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), ASHA joined a coalition of organizations urging President Trump to maintain the necessary funding in order to continue addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States in the FY18 federal budget.
Protecting Patients
ASHA joined a broad coalition of patient and community organizations in urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain and enforce important patient protections and access to prescription drugs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Services
As part of the Family Planning Coalition, ASHA joined 60 organizations requesting appropriate funding for the Title X family planning program. Title X family planning clinics play a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Supporting Planned Parenthood and Cancer Prevention
Services that Planned Parenthood health centers provide to 2.5 million patients each year include screenings for cervical and breast cancers, respectively, and tobacco use/smoking cessation counseling. The majority of patients who depend on the health centers live under the federal poverty level, so it’s crucial to oppose any cuts to funding for their life-saving programs and services. ASHA created a sign on letter from cervical cancer survivors discussing the importance of access from a cancer survivor’s perspective and sent it to the appropriate Senate leadership.
State Policies
As a national organization, ASHA primarily focuses on federal policy issues. However, there are many sexual issues affected by policies enacted at the state level, from abortion rights, to access to emergency contraception, to sex education. These policies can vary widely from state to state. For example, according to the Guttmacher Institute 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information on contraception be provided in sex education classes, while 37 states require that information on abstinence be offered, and 19 require that instruction on the importance of engaging in sexual activity only within marriage be provided. Guttmacher offers monthly state policy updates in all topics of sexual and reproductive health and is an excellent resource for state-level developments.
The National Conference of State Legislatures is another resource for state-level policy issues, including teen dating violence, HPV vaccine statutes, and transgender rights, including so-called “bathroom bills.” These bills are restrict access to restrooms, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities in public buildings—individuals are required to use facilities that correspond the their sex assigned at birth, limiting access for transgender persons. While North Carolina is currently the only state that passed such a bill (which has now been repealed), sixteen other states introduced similar legislation in 2017.

HPV Tests Take Center Stage
October 4,2019
It used to be so simple: go for an annual Pap! The venerable Pap is now frequently used as a co-test along with a test for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.  In this episode Dr. Latoya Patterson breaks down the current approaches to screening for cervical cancer including the newest option, HPV primary screening, where an HPV test is used without being paired with a Pap test. The Pap test still has a role, though, so tune in to find out all about it!
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
September 25, 2019
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
Bacterial Vaginosis and Vaginal Health
July 7, 2019
In this episode, we’re talking about bacterial vaginosis, or BV, the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. Dr. Noor Abualnadi, a gynecologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, helps break down the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. So listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.
HIV Testing Day 2019
June 27, 2019
An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS and the CDC says about 1 in 7 don’t know their status. Testing is so important and thankfully we’ve seen great progress with the evolution of both HIV diagnostic technologies and the availability of effective treatment options. On HIV Testing Day 2019 we remember the clinical/medical side of things is only part of the HIV struggle: There remains much to do in the areas of justice, equality, and dealing with stigma. We end this episode with a wrap-up of Men’s Health Month and a free download of the Health is Power toolkit to help organizations communicate positive sexual health messages to young African-American men.
Big Changes! New HPV Vaccine Protocols and Update to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
February 6,2019
Since our last update on HPV and cervical cancer some big changes have occurred: HPV vaccination has been approved for use with males and females through age 45 and updated cervical cancer screening guidelines now include an option for HPV primary testing (translation: an HPV test done alone without a Pap as a co-test).  In this episode Ina Park, MD, breaks all of this down and peeks at a future where we might actually be able to discuss the elimination of cervical cancer. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine.
Herpes Diagnosis and Management: A Two-Part Conversation with Terri Warren, ANP
In this two-part episode, Terri Warren, ANP—nurse, author, and owner of Westover Heights Clinic in Portland, Oregon that specializes in the genital herpes infection—explains the tests that can provide an accurate genital herpes diagnosis and how they work and clarifies that a physical exam alone should never be the final diagnosis for anyone, for many reasons. She also discusses the importance of knowing herpes type and offers helpful insight into how to put a herpes infection into proper perspective.
Sexual Pleasure beyond the Big “O”
A conversation with sexuality and relationship expert Dr. Logan Levkoff
March 9, 2018
In this episode we chat with Dr. Logan Levkoff on the value of pleasure not only in a relationship but as part of our overall well-being.

Listen in as Dr. Levkoff dishes on everything from not only having more sex but better sex, and why sexual pleasure doesn’t need to involve a partner!
Chronic Pelvic Pain in Women
February 23,2018
Beyond the physical discomfort they experience, women with chronic pelvic pain often have to navigate choppy waters emotionally and in their relationships. Dr. Karen Tang with the Gynecology Specialists of Philadelphia practice joins us to talk about the many possible causes of chronic pelvic pain and approaches to treatment. She offers practical advice not only for women but their partners, too. Visit http://philadelphiagyn.com/ for patient education resources including videos with Dr. Tang.
Treat Me Right: The Continued Evolution of Therapies for Cervical Cancer
January 26, 2018
The development of new treatment options for cervical cancer has been frustratingly slow but Dr. Kathleen Moore of the University of Oklahoma’s Stephenson Cancer Center says that may finally be changing. In this episode we chat about current therapies for cervical cancer, take a glimpse into the pipeline to see what’s being developed and finish with a discussion on the crucial role of clinical trials in expanding our treatment arsenal.
Proposed Changes to Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
December 28, 2017
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published a draft of updated cervical cancer screening guidelines and some big changes are proposed. For insight on why check-ups for cervical cancer continue to change and move away from the traditional annual Pap, in this episode, we chat with Mark H. Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair of OB/GYN and Women’s Health at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
A Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties
December 27, 2017
Female sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom. When sex isn’t easy how do you even begin this conversation with your partner or, for that matter, your healthcare provider? Sociologist, sexologist and relationship expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz joins our Sex+Health podcast for a three-part discussion on the range of female sexual difficulties and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You’re not alone! NOTE: the findmyspark.com website mentioned in these episodes is currently unavailable so for information on females sexual difficulties visit ASHA’s pages on women’s health. We also offer a patient education resource ASHA developed in collaboration with WebMD Education, Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause.
Episode One: How do female sexual difficulties (FSD) affect relationships in and out of the bedroom?
Episode Two: Concerned your partner is no longer in the mood? It may be more than you think.
Episode Three: Diving deeper into the most common female sexual difficulty (FSD), Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), and the other types of FSD that may be affecting your relationship.
Gynecological Health Awareness Month
September 8, 2017
It’s Gynecological Cancer Awareness Month—time to talk about cancers that affect more than 89,000 women in the US each year. Mamta Singhvi, MD, a radiation oncologist and ASHA board member, discusses various ways gynecologic cancers are treated, what to expect during and following treatment and issues around prevention and early detection.
World Sexual Health Day
September 8, 2017
In this episode, Dr. Eli Coleman, director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota and a former member of ASHA’s board of directors, talks about developing a broader view of sexual health that goes beyond merely having sex with another person.
Men’s Health Month 2017
July 17, 2017
We ruminate on men and sexual health in this episode with Dr. Abe Morgentaler of Men’s Health Boston and ASHA’s vice president for strategic partnerships Kay Phillips. Both offer their insights and we highlight the tools and resources ASHA offers for men (and organizations serving them).
Talking to Girls and Young Women about S-E-X
May 15, 2017
“[Girls] have told by society that sex is great but that’s not their experience. They don’t know how to talk about that disconnect, there’s a certain amount of shame that shuts down their voice….for me, sexual empowerment for girls is helping them to find a voice in their sexual relationships.”
In a compelling TED Talk video, nurse practitioner Jane Epstein makes the case that our efforts are sadly lacking with it comes to talking to teen girls and young women. In this episode of ASHA’s podcast we delve deeper into the topic with Ms. Epstein on not only what to say when talking to young females about sex, but how to help them speak up for themselves.
Jane Epstein is a Yale graduate and a clinician who sees teenagers at a high school-based health clinic where, as part of comprehensive health care, she provides sexual health care including contraception services to teens.
HPV “Miracle Cures”
January 4, 2017
We’re frequently asked about websites touting unlicensed, off-the-grid vaccines and supplements that claim to cure HPV and related diseases. In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, breaks down the more common HPV “miracle cures” and also answers the most common questions about legitimate, approved HPV vaccines.
Men’s Sexual Health
September 28, 2016
There are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships. Guys are seen as always turned on, selfish in the bedroom, and not all that interested in their partner once the carnal tango ends. Is that fair?
To find out we chatted with men’s sexual health expert Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, the director and founder of Men’s Health Boston, and a member of ASHA’s board of directors. He’s also the author of The Truth About Men and Sex: Intimate Secrets from the Doctor’s Office.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.
Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

Sweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.

Desperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”
Access Denied:
Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

ASHA’s work is focused around three important objectives:
Educate: Be the source of scientifically-based and accessible information
Build Alliances: Collaborate with other organizations to expand the understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model
Advocate: Advance supportive changes in sexual health policy
Educate
Thousands of individuals turn to ASHA each year looking for information and guidance from a reliable source. Our many websites and publications serve as a critical means of information and support to users around the world who have difficulty accessing clear, non-biased information on sexual and reproductive health. From individuals with questions on sexually transmitted infections, to parents looking for advice on how to talk to their kids about sexual health, to patients looking for support, ASHA is a trusted resource. And with our grassroots program the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, we also offer that education and support in local communities as well.
Our education efforts extend to specific audiences beyond the general public, including healthcare providers. From the creation of continuing education programs for physicians to the development of resources such as toolkits, videos and apps geared toward providers, ASHA works to ensure that providers can offer the best sexual health care to their patients.
With their ability to reach wide audience, the media are also an important target of ASHA’s outreach. We work with a wide range of media outlets—TV, radio, print media, and popular web outlets—as a sought-after commentator on news and trends in popular culture that touch on sexual health issues, promoting positive coverage that destigmatizes the subject.
Build Alliances
We work with a number of national organizations and that share our goals of promoting sexual health issues in order to strengthen advocacy for sexual health promotion. ASHA is a key member of such entities as the National Sexual Health Coalition, the North American Federation of Sexual Health Organizations, and Cervical Cancer Free America. We also regularly bring together and consult with professionals in the field to promote better understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model.
Advocate
ASHA maintains a policy office in Washington, DC, affirming its long-term commitment to advocacy for systemic change. ASHA’s Washington office works to secure sound policy responses to the sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic in the areas of prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and education through efforts with policymakers and national organizations. ASHA has been successful in obtaining bipartisan support for STI programs and continues to educate policy makers about the economic, social, and public health benefits of appropriate STI policy.
We work in coalition with organizations in family planning, HIV, and women’s health, as well as organizations representing people of color and faith-based groups to keep STIs on the forefront of the policy agenda. ASHA is routinely asked to provide strategy and content advice on sexual health-related issues to a variety of national organizations and also provides leadership on numerous boards and committees.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

I suffer from a stigma, not a disease.
I have had HSV-1 since I was a kid and HSV-2 since I was 19. I am 40 now. After all these years, I have this to share with anyone who’s been newly diagnosed with genital herpes: Do not be ashamed of yourself for having on your genitals what most people have on their mouths! It just doesn’t make sense. Most people have this virus on their mouths, and yet we don’t shame them, make them self-disclose before each kiss, think they are dirty, or get scared of kissing them between outbreaks!
If I had a magic wand I would get rid of herpes stigma. I would do this even before I’d use the magic wand to create a herpes cure. This infection rarely cause me any trouble. I’ve had flea bites that hurt worse than an outbreak. What I suffer from is people’s judgement and ignorance. And I’ve been very lucky — in 20 years of having this virus, few people have rejected me, and were polite when they did. I’ve heard terrible horror stories about the kind of rejection others have gotten. And it’s simply not fair, not logical, and doesn’t follow medical facts.
I used to get angry by the rejection. It’s a very small risk at an infection that causes mild symptoms! But what they really risk is catching something that stigmatizes them. They don’t want to catch the stigma. No one wants to suffer from the stigma, and it’s the stigma we need to fight.
Don’t be ashamed! You’re still as good and worthy and beautiful as you were before.
I was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999 . . .I’m a gay man who was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999. Fortunately I only experienced a short-term (or acute) infection and am fine. Hepatitis B can be really serious, though, and I know I’m fortunate. Each and every gay man should have the hepatitis B vaccine. I wish I had gotten it when I was younger. Learn from me, and get your hep B shots! Take an HIV test. Use condoms. Don’t depend just on what the medical community says to do, take control and do something!
I have chlamydia . . .
I’m 19 years old and I have chlamydia. I was diagnosed with it last year, and have been treated. I feel like I was very stupid at the time I got it. I was 18, had a boyfriend who I thought loved me. I thought sex would make him treat me better. Big mistake. I cry every night and hardly sleep as I fear I let it go too far before getting treated, and I might not be able to have children.
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old.
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old. At first the doctors told me it was nothing to worry about, that it would probably go away on its own. I had no idea at the time what type of HPV I had nor did I know that some types of the virus are linked to cervical cancer. No one told me! I had normal Paps for 3 years after that and it did not seem like a big deal until at 28 I was diagnosed with CIN-3 [significant cervical pre-cancer] and had a LEEP. That freaked me out big time. I went through all the common feelings of guilt and shame. I told potential sexual partners about HPV and I did not have one guy freak out on me. They were all really cool about it. It helps that since men don’t have a cervix, there really is no real fear of cancer–the incidence of HPV-related penile cancer is extremely low.
At the end of the day, I don’t know who gave me HPV and I don’t really care anymore. What I do know is that in some ways HPV has been a very positive thing in my life. Having HPV taught me how to speak up and be honest, how to take care of myself better (stress is an aggravating factor) and most of all, to become my own advocate. To all of you out there struggling with this diagnosis, know that you are not alone. Millions of people have HPV, even if they don’t talk about it. You are not damaged or defective in any way. You are perfect just as you are. Take some deep breaths and know that everything is going to be OK!
My HPV diagnosis
I went for my routine yearly check up but this time I went to a different gynecologist thinking that it will be just another boring consultation where they just make me uncomfortable. Dr. Watson started explaining what HPV is and how many women die of cervical cancer, she also said that she only uses the liquid Pap test as it is more accurate than the conventional Pap test. With the innovation of the liquid pap test, 100 percent of the sample is sent to the lab. This means technicians have more cells to make a determination from and have a clearer sample to look at. Lab technicians who read these slides say the difference is like night and day between the traditional Pap and the new liquid technology. I just heard “blah-blah-blah” and couldn’t wait to leave. Dr. Watson looked at me and with a very strict voice said, “Women are not educated enough about these things and think ‘It can’t happen to me.'” This is when I though, “Well I’m very healthy so it cannot happen to me.” I went home waiting for the little piece of paper to arrive in the post saying “normal” but instead Dr. Watson phoned me a week later to make an appointment for a biopsy as there were pre-cancerous cells detected caused by HPV.
Suddenly everything stopped. My busy day at work did not matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore. I can die for crying out loud!! My head was spinning with all these questions. I was so angry to think that I did go for my normal Pap test every year and wasted all that money because not once did they pick it up?
After a long 4 day wait I went back to the gynecologist. I was strapped in like a horse when she performed the biopsy and promised myself never to complain again when going for a Pap test. Dr. Watson phoned me a few days later as she needed to discuss the results with me and that she has scheduled an operation. My whole world stopped again. I could believe my ears. The test results showed that I have HPV type 16 and CIN III, the liquid test only showed CIN II. The worst part was when she said that if she cannot get everything out, I will have to go for a hysterectomy after three months, which means no babies! I’m 27 years old and she is telling me no babies!! I was hysterical.
While lying on the operating table I thought of all the people having such a jolly time with their families, it’s not fair but I know my life is much more worth than a slice of Christmas cake. I am one lucky girl as Dr. Watson confirmed the operation to be very successful, the end is almost here!!
Getting testedI have been intimate with my girlfriend for almost two years now and as of a couple of months ago, I noticed warts growing in the area where the penis meets the groin. I don’t have what most people commonly refer to as a clear complexion, quite the opposite really, and that’s precisely what I took these growths to be. I had begun shaving in the pubic area as an intimate courtesy and it was only through this shaving that I first noticed the growths. My history of bad skin coupled with the added irritation of shaving led me to believe these growths were a natural reaction.
After a week or two of unchanged status in the warts I went to the city clinic where I endured the gambit of STD testing as well as a visual examination of the growths. The doctor offered an acid treatment, but recommended a consultation for laser surgery, in which case, she preferred I had nothing done at this point. I don’t have health insurance and although I called and made an appointment at the city hospital, I don’t foresee laser removal as a realistic option.
Here is where the story gets a little strange. Two weeks ago, my girlfriend scheduled an HPV/Pap test to check herself out. One week ago she received the results: negative! Negative?? Prior to communicating my concerns for my own health I had revealed to my girlfriend that she was my first and only, despite comments I may have made that made it sound I were a bit more seasoned in intimate relationships. This fact is true. I have nothing to gain (and everything to lose) by lying about this further. So I found myself in a precarious situation which almost wanted her test to come out positive so we knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what was happening to me and if it was serious.
I scheduled for more testing at a clinic closer to where I lived in the suburbs. The visual examination here was much more definitive and decisive. The doctor immediately identified the growths as genital warts and treated them immediately with acid. I am to return to the clinic for continued treatments until the warts disappear. But now my girlfriend is left in a situation even more ambiguous than when we began. I explained the test results to the doctor at the second clinic to which she said that “It didn’t matter,” and she could still have some kind of lesion that caused this in the first place.
Our situation never degenerated into rampant distrust. I knew she had multiple partners in the past and she knew of my virginity after revealing it later on. I still love her very much, perhaps even now more so because revealing this to other family and friends and relying on their support would shame me to an exponential level. I could never live with that knowledge in their hands. This is something I must hide from all others in my life, but found the need to tell my tale during research into diagnosis and treatment. Here are the most important things I learned from this experience thus far:
It is much better to have health insurance and consequently, doctors and staff who seem more interested in wanting to actually help you.
People that work in the clinics are very focused on HIV testing. If you want them to look or test for something else, you MUST TELL THEM and you can only do that by doing some research on your own first. Again, bear in mind these doctors are more like factory line workers with your problems as opposed to a PCP.
Go for a second opinion, especially if the first one is free.
If you must keep things quiet to other friends and family, your partner is your only support. Continue to love him or her or end the relationship quickly!
Although some clinics have “counselors,” they are not the sort that actually talk to you and try to make you feel better after a positive viral diagnosis. This will require a LOT of soul searching if you don’t have a shrink and almost unbearable if you are not speaking with your partner.
I thought I was invincibleLike many, I was/am pretty well educated on STDs. However, I still felt that I was “invincible” to sexual diseases and NEVER would have expected to get one.
I have had three partners—all long-term serious relationships. At age seventeen, I’m not what most would expect an “HPV infected person(s)” to be. I graduated two years early, I was a cheerleader for my college, I graduated high school with a 4.0, I’ve held 2 state beauty pageant titles, and currently hold a local title on my way to state! The important thing is—NO ONE is invincible, and it can happen to ANYBODY. That’s part of the risk we take being sexually active.
In my case, knowledge is power. I discovered “skin-tag-like” warts on and around my vaginal opening. I figured it was an allergic reaction to a bubble bath or something. After a week of no improvements, I did research on genital warts on the internet. I was almost positive I had them. I told me mother and we went to the doctor, and I am now undergoing treatment.
Unlike many others, I was able to trace the source of my STD. It was my first boyfriend and first partner. He had no idea he was carrying the virus (since there are often no symptoms). Since me, he has had over 10 partners…meaning possibly infecting over 10 people. They say, “You sleep with whoever your partner has slept with.” Never has the saying affected me more. I called him and told him what I had, what he had, what he should do (regarding telling his past partners), treatment he should seek, and other key facts. Once again, knowledge is power.
I also called my most recent ex and partner in addition to the first. I was screamed at, and cursed, and he even threatened to kill me. It brought out a side I had never seen. It hurt, but I did the right thing. I now understand why STD prevention may be difficult–it is hard to tell someone, especially when you get such a harsh reaction. I can’t lie. It was embarrassing, heartbreaking, and shameful. But as I told him, STDs are just one part of the risk we take from being sexually active, especially as teens.
Now to my third partner—my fiance. I have infected him. We are going to a clinic (so his parents won’t find out) next week for him. Luckily there are many low cost and even free STD screening and treatment centers for cases just like this. It was so hard for us to get through this. He, unlike me, waited for “the one” before having sex. Being honored, I never once thought that I might be capable of transmitting a disease to him. As he put it at first, “It’s like working and working and working hard for something your whole life- and then having it blow up in your face.”
Yes, I gave my love an STD. The “perfect” varsity player with perfect grades. We found out that knowledge/education and communication is key. Though my communication issues were a bit more than just between us, it was something that had to be done. Something to think about. My first partner was angry, and so embarrassed, he refuses to tell the 10+ people he slept with. Assuming they follow a pattern, in a years span (since he started having sex with others)- they sleep with three males. That’s over 30 people infected because of someone not speaking the truth.
I have HPV. So does my fiance. We are normal- perhaps even considered “exceptional”—college students. His past: 0 partners. My past: 2 partners. All protected sex. We have HPV for the rest of my life. But we get through it together.
Rape and HPVAbout a year and one month ago, my high school coach raped me. He was my idol, my mentor, and one of my closest friends. He helped me to believe in myself, helped get me a scholarship to run at a university, and then helped me to train for my first season as a college athlete. I tried to push him off of me, but I guess it doesn’t matter.
Afterwards, I walked to my car, put my head down on my steering wheel and hyperventilated for a while— disbelief is what I like to call it. “Everyone has a skeleton and a closet to keep it in”—he’s mine. I wonder if he knows what he did. A few months later, I was diagnosed with HPV. He took everything from me, but at least he gave me something in return. “You’ve left me with nothing, but I’ve worked with less.”
Growing up in a life filled with sexual abuse and betrayal, my only defense is to forget…even when it’s happening. HPV makes it hard to forget – I am defenseless, now. When I was diagnosed, my doctor told me nothing about what I had and treated it as if it was nothing. I guess it probably was for her – she wasn’t on that table in nothing but a hospital gown. She didn’t shiver on top of that crinkly white paper while someone stuck something up inside her – maybe I shouldn’t have cared either. All these years I have been alone in my struggle with self-respect and trust. I have kept quiet, leaving my pain in little jars that I sometimes like to touch, trying to remember what it’s like to feel.
“I’ve been treated so wrong, I’ve been treated so long as if I’m becoming untouchable.” My saving grace was the hope that one day I would be far enough from my experiences that they wouldn’t hurt anymore. Last May, all of that changed with the diagnosis of HPV – a silent reminder of the pain that will follow me the rest of my life.
I recently entered into a relationship with the man that I hope to be my husband one day. He has been infinitely patient with me and with all of my fears. The second date we went on, we sat in the dark after watching a movie. Upon request, he gave me a pen and a piece of paper and waited while I scrawled a note to him stating that I had been raped and that I had HPV. I told him that he could take me or leave me, but to do it now. He didn’t leave.
The past couple of days, this “infection” has been especially painful…both physically and mentally. I had never realized that HPV could lead to cervical cancer – no one ever told me. I found out when a commercial came on TV about asking for the HPV test. I spent many nights doing research before the ad came on TV, but I just got frustrated and felt more and more disgusting. I couldn’t see through my tears to really understand what I was reading. When I saw that ad, it was as if someone had lifted a curtain and light came shining through.
The man I spoke of previously sent me an email today, with a link to this website in it. He pleaded with me to just take a look. He tried to tell me that I shouldn’t be ashamed, that I wasn’t alone.
I don’t really know where I’m going with this and I know that you will cut this down if you decide to put it up on your site. It’s ok even if you decide not to put it up at all. I’m not going to read over what I’ve written so that I don’t decide not to send it. Whoever you are, you’re one of the precious few that has any idea that this has happened to me. I’m sorry if this has been hard to understand… I’m just tired of silence. I just want someone to know.
I knew it was a risk for my health but...I’ve been dating the same boy for 10 years. We’ve been together since we were 16. This is the boy I’m willing to marry; the only one I’ve ever loved. Two years ago, I met a man who was 12 years my senior and completely drove me crazy. For the first time in my life I was going to be unfaithful. We had unprotected intercourse. I perfectly knew it was a risk for my health but…in those moments I did not care.
In February this year I went on for my annual Pap test and I found out I have HPV. I did not know anything about this disease. That man gave it to me. At first I thought my life was ruined, I had to talk with my boyfriend and with my father, who’s a doctor. So I did. It’s been difficult but my boyfriend decided to support me and he s still fighting with me, despite I could give him HPV. Today I’ve been told that I have high risk HPV, so I decided to write my story. HPV won’t let me down, I’ll fight and I’ll win. I thank God for my boyfriend support, and I thank your website for all your precious information.
Knowing that I’m not alone has made me feel normal againI just found out about a month ago that I have the type of HPV that causes warts. It had been six months since I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years so needless to say it was a another sting to an open wound, since I had not been with anyone since our breakup. I was so scared and angry when diagnosed. I’m 29 now and I had always been aware of STDs, and I made my last two boyfriends get checked for STDs before I had unprotected sex. Little did I know about HPV and that men could be carriers and not know it.
I racked my brain for so long to try and figure out who gave it to me…was it my boyfriend…did he cheat on me…did he already have it and not know it…did I have it before we dated and not know it?? I have finally been able to release all of those questions because I know it only adds stress to my life and will not make the HPV go away.
I’m still working on clearing the warts and regaining my spirit and health. I know in time it will all work out and it has defiantly made me respect my body that much more. Of the three friends that I talked to about my HPV, two of them confided that they have the high-risk HPV. Knowing that I’m not alone has really helped and has made me feel normal again.
I’m still scared to date and unsure how to deal with this. Two doctors I have spoken to have told me that in the beginning as long as I’m using condoms and I’m wart free I don’t need to tell anyone. But I wear my heart on my sleeve and I just don’t think I could be intimate with someone without them knowing. Plus at this point in my life I don’t feel the need to have sex with anyone until I know them well enough to have an STD talk. After all I still have to respect my body and do the best I can to protect myself from other STDs, and anyone that does not respect that is not someone I want to be intimate with.
'I encourage physicians to be honest with their patientsI was married for 20 years and my regular Pap smears were always normal. When a “no-fault” divorce completely traumatized my life, I was under tremendous stress. At one point I was working 7 days a week while going back to college full-time in order to get my degree, while at the same time running a household and raising a teenage son. (No-fault divorce has eliminated alimony and in many cases even child support; I was supporting my son and myself on a $10/hr job. Thanks to no-fault divorce laws, I did not qualify for food stamps either, or any other assistance.)
To make a long story short, I went for a Pap smear a year ago, and I was shocked to find that the result was abnormal. I couldn’t imagine how I could have contracted a sexually transmitted disease.
My family physician probably did not want to alarm me, so he merely suggested that I follow a regimen of special douches for a few months and then come back to see him after that. However, he did not tell me I had HPV. I assumed it was a minor problem such as a chronic yeast infection—although I was not experiencing any symptoms—so I did not go back. He did not call to follow-up, either. I changed jobs and doctors, and the first thing I did was go for a physical with a Pap smear; I was curious to see whether that yeast infection had disappeared. When the Pap smear was abnormal again, I was scared. And, I was angry with my previous physician for not telling me the facts. Had I known the abnormal Pap smear meant HPV, I certainly would have followed up with a treatment program.
I would encourage all physicians to be honest with their patients, and to provide information about HPV with every Pap smear.
Most importantly, I believe that stress is the reason for my suppressed immune system. More research needs to focus on the effects of stress on health. Thank you.
What a roller coaster ride this has beenI just want to take a moment to thank everyone who wrote in and to share my story. I was just diagnosed with high-risk HPV yesterday. What a roller coaster ride this has been. I received a call about about two weeks ago from my gynecologist’s secretary, in an OB/GYN practice, that I had to make an appointment to discuss my results. How nerve-wrecking it was to get a phone call like that. What made the whole situation worse is that I could not come in for my appointment until more than a week and a half later.
I tried to get as much information as possible about my results from the secretary and was told–in a not so pleasant way-—”all I can tell you is that is has something to do with your Pap smear.” So, I made the appointment and and tried to go on with business as usual…but of course I couldn’t. I did tons of internet searches on Pap Smear results and soon discovered HPV. After doing as much reading as I could possibly do, I came to the conclusion that I had HPV.
What is sad is that I am a public health professional and did not know about high-risk HPV. I only associated HPV with genital warts. I never knew that there was an HPV that was wart-less and caused cervical cancer. I know I made some not-too-bright decisions regarding my sexual activity, but for the most part I have always been pretty careful. I was regularly tested for STDs and had my partners tested for STDs when we started having a sexual relationship. I have only had 3 sexual partners and did not lose my virginity until I was 23. I’m 28 now.
When my doctor diagnosed me yesterday with HPV, even though I knew that this diagnosis was a very strong possibility, I was absolutely shocked. I have never had an STD before. I spent most of yesterday in a daze and remained in complete disbelief for the remainder of the day. But today is a brand new day and I am filled with brand new hope.
I want everyone on this website to feel as comfortable with being diagnosed with HPV as I now do. The truth is that almost every sexually active person will be diagnosed with HPV at some point in their lives…and it is not the end of the world. In fact, HPV testing is not a standard screen because it is so common. It doesn’t make sense to make a big deal out of it if its not causing any problems…which is often the case. But when an abnormal Pap Smear shows up, then you test for HPV so you can discover the origin of the abnormal cells. The good news is that regular Pap Smears can stop the progression of abnormal cells in their tracks. What’s even better news is that a healthy immune system naturally fights HPV and most people will test negative for HPV within a year or two—or even less.
The thing is, the virus is so common, its possible that you can be infected several times. The key for women is to be sure to have Pap tests regularly. Men, apparently you’re not affected at all by high-risk HPV. There are no clinical manifestations for you and no tests to determine if you have it. But you can give it to your sexual partner and if your partner has a cervix, it can infect her cervix and lead to abnormal cell growth.
I say all of this to say… KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT!!!
My miscarriageI found out I was infected with chlamydia a few months ago. About 2 months before that I was pregnant with my first child, which now I have found out that I miscarried my child because I was infected. I advise all to use protection as i can tell you it was hard enough finding out I had chlamydia let alone finding out it was the cause of my miscarriage! Now I have tried to fall pregnant again…I was extremely fertile before I had chlamydia and now I can’t even fall pregnant again. I’ve decided to just give my body a rest and just hope that I can conceive again. And to make things worse I will never no how long I had the infection for as my past partners refuse to be tested! So I’m stuck wandering who I caught it from and who I may have given it to. I had no symptoms that I noticed then now I know more about it I can say why didn’t I think something was wrong before!! It was because I didn’t know about it. I just hope that people will read this and think more carefully when going out or having sex because you always say to yourself “Oh well that’ll never happen to me,” and then it does and it ruins your life!
Thank you and I hope my story can help people to realize that you can get it and it can happen to you!
Why can't teens get tested?My name is Christina and I’m a 16 year old sophomore in high school. During my first year in high school I engaged in sexual activities. Ever since then, things haven’t been the same. I really want to go to a clinic and get tested for HIV/AIDS and STDs but I’m scared to let my parents know that I’m sexually active. No clinics would let me get tested without my parents and that’s a huge problem!
Many of my peers are going through the same thing with me. We want to get tested but refuse to tell our parents. This isn’t so good because, what if we are infected? How would we know? Would the infection only get worse? Well the point I’m trying to get across is that, there should clinics for teens to go to without their parents to get tested. I’m not saying this just because I’m terrified of my parents, but it’s been a thought on my mind for a while. Most teens would rather sit and let their infection grow other than telling their parents to take them to a clinic. Pregnancy testing shouldn’t be the only thing a teen can do without their parents’ consent. Please give me some feedback, maybe there are clinics that I don’t know about.
Editors note: You can search for a clinic that offers STD testing near you.
You made me feel like a person, not a statisticI am a 25 year old woman that was diagnosed with HPV about 2 months ago. I received an abnormal Pap smear result. I told my boyfriend at the time what was going on, and he flipped out, blaming me and yelling that I gave him this virus. I went for the colposcopy, and found out I had mild-moderate dysplasia and would have to have a LEEP procedure. I was terrified. I asked how I got the virus and what it was. When my doctor told me it was an STD, I started crying, thinking it was impossible. I had several partners in the past years, but made sure I always wore a condom and had thought I was being very careful. My doctor then explained to me that condom use does not always protect against HPV. I was outraged. I felt that for years, people have been lied to in a way. Education about sex and condoms does not include the fact that condoms do not protect against HPV.
The emotional strain this put on my relationship caused us to break up. I went in shortly thereafter for my LEEP procedure. I have been healing for about three weeks and am going for a checkup soon. I am scared that the Pap smear will come back abnormal again. I talked with my doctor previously to the LEEP and he found in my past Pap smears (dating 3 years ago), there was dysplasia present, just not severe enough to treat. They had assumed it would go away by itself. It is inconclusive if the strain I have now is recurrent or a new one, but it’s startling to think I have had this for so long without even knowing it.
In the past couple weeks, I started a relationship with another guy, and the subject of past sexual history came up. I took a chance and told him about the HPV, explaining what it was and how it’s contracted. He was very understanding, and admitted he had heard of the effects of the virus, but had never heard of HPV. The question still remains whether or not to abstain from sex, we have really hit it off and things are moving at a nice pace, but it was heart wrenching to tell him what was going on with me. I believe I got lucky with his reaction, as there is such a stigma surrounding the idea of contracting a STD. It is important people are educated on the fact that this is not your normal STD. Even with precautions, it is very contagious. I feel better knowing that myself, but I also feel people will not find out about this unless they are infected.
I do want to thank you for posting un-biased information on HPV. You made me feel like a person again, not a statistic.
HIV and TBAt fifteen I started playing high school sports. I was the average athlete playing basketball, football, and baseball. I was to my high school piers known as a square because I did not curse, drink, party or do drugs. I was voted ”Most Friendly” by my senior class at Lexington High. I was proud of my accomplishment in high school. I lettered in three varsity sports, I was voted MVP of the baseball team my senior year and I was told by my basketball coach before graduation that many things in life would come easier for me because I had God on my side.
At age 24, I started my career in hotel management, continued coaching little league and singing gospel music along the east coast. At age 28 is when I came “out of the closet” to my parents that I was gay and I was condemned to hell from my family. It was then that I left Lexington and moved to North Carolina continuing my career in hotel management, continuing my singing and visiting churches that loved me even though I was gay and allowed me to worship with them.
It is now the year 2000. I moved to Richmond and I met my life partner Brad in March and started a relationship that has blessed me tremendously. Have we had problems? Yes, the devil intervened and not being able to find a church that I was happy with, I backslid.
Four years later on July 22, 2004 at 7:00AM. While working 11-7 that night I developed some health problems that I had to seek medical attention for. It was then that I was diagnosed with HIV. I can still remember how I felt those first few minutes after the doctor had told me I had HIV. My partner Brad stood in the window waiting for some bad news but he never expected this bad news. So many questions crossed my mind at that time. Was my partner of 4 years going to leave me? How long was I going to live? Who gave it to me? What were my parents going to say? How many friends will I loose? It was a month later after having a biopsy that I was told also that not only did I have HIV but I had tuberculosis.
For months after my diagnosis I was bedridden. The side affect that I had from my HIV and TB medications were so severe that I remember telling my partner, “if this is what it takes to survive, I’m not sure I want to live”. Not able to eat anything solid for months I lost 39 pounds.
The good news is since my diagnosis I have found my reason for living. I don’t believe my health problems are because I am gay but because I needed a wake up call from God to get back into the ministry. The wake up call worked.
STD vs. STII am a health teacher at the high school level and I feel that changing STD to STI makes the issue not as important. Students see STI as something similar to a sinus infection, ear infection, yeast infection. All things that are curable and do not have long term side effects or cause other health issues (HPV/AIDS/genital warts—effect on babies born vaginally, etc.). This sends a very confusing message to the students. They understand that STDs are much more serious and view STIs as not that big of an issue because of the word “infection” vs. “disease.”
I would consider the thought process of a teenager (middle school-12-13 years old and high school 13-18). These are the groups that are having sex and not using protection. These students need to understand the implications of the choices of they make and changing meanings and definitions are just going to confuse the issue. Please reconsider the change from STD to STI.
Telling potential partners is terribly hardAt first i didn’t really think i had a problem. I went to a woman’s clinic a few weeks after I found out my boyfriend had cheated on me with at least 2 people. I told her I just wanted to make sure I hadn’t caught anything from him. About a month before I had met him (so would be 9 months up to that point) I had gone for my annual pap test and there were no problems. One week after that pap test I received a call from the doctor telling me that I was to see a GYN doc as i had signs of “pre-cancerous cells” on my cervix.
I went to the doctor and he performed some biopsies taking 4 pieces from my cervix which hurt tremendously. Another week went by and I received a call telling me that I had all 3 signs of precancerous cells on my cervix, calling it dysplasia (not one word of HPV or whatever I had). I was then scheduled for cervical laser surgery and told that it should take care of all my problems. The follow up pap was supposed to be 3 months after the surgery but due to cancellations and delays and emergencies (was supposed to be August ended up late February the next year). This time the follow up was with my family doctor and as I was having the pap I asked him about these really small itchy bumps I could feel there and I wanted to know what they were.
He told me rather abruptly and without care “The doctor had to have told you that you have HPV and also genital warts when he treated you right?” Well let’s just say my mouth dropped and I was stunned. I not only didn’t know that I had HPV I had no clue I had genital warts until that moment and I really didn’t even understand what he said. I came home and started reading up on it and as you can imagine i became increasingly upset. I hadn’t been with anyone for 8 years before this guy, and had never had an abnormal pap before that. I was devastated, he put me on Aldara for 16 weeks and all it did was make them itchier and larger. He then determined to laser them off. The healing for that took a month and now I am scarred with pigment loss where all the lesions were. I have had a few come back which have been acid removed but still it’s one of the most depressing, hardest things I have ever had to deal with. Telling potential partners is terribly hard.
I haven’t seen any in about 7 months now so hoping it’s finally, hopefully, going to clear up as far as being there visibly. I have been dealing with this for 5 years now and not sure if it will ever end. I have heard of a few here who have gotten this HPV and because they are lesion-free for 6 months they feel they have gotten rid of it, therefore not telling partners about it. I am totally upset about the misconceptions about this STD, as it gets so many people and they don’t think anything of it.
When I told one of the girls where I worked that I had pre-cancerous cells on my cervix she matter of fact told me that she’s had that done 4 times. I don’t think she was aware of how bad this can be. Unfortunately for me I was passed on at least 2 types, the low risk and the high risk and I was not informed by my own doctor at the time. By the doctor taking a year to tell me I feel that was irresponsible as I may have infected someone in that year.
That’s what happened to me, hopefully they will come up with something that will get rid of this in people who already have it and not just prevent it from happening. Thank you for reading my story.
Why isn't there more awareness?I am 23 years old and have only been sexually active for one year. My first partner and I went to the city clinic to be tested for HIV and STDs. When they told us we were negative on everything I thought there was nothing else to worry about. I got on the pill and we made it a point to always use a condom. I thought I was being safe but little did I know there was something called HPV and my boyfriend at the time carried the virus. I went for a routine pap three months ago and was told that I had HPV and that it was in its 3rd stage of its growth (the fourth is cancer). I went through a freezing process in hope that it would remove my abnormal cells. My cells regenerated and I’m incredibly upset that i never heard about this (HPV) until I had it. Why wasn’t there more awareness? Why can’t we find more ways to test men? If I had known my ex-boyfriend carried the virus I wouldn’t have slept with him. I am mad that now I have deal with this condition and go through further treatments simply because there wasn’t enough awareness to warn me.
How did I end up with an STD?I am 34 years old. I have been married for 6 years and have had only one sex partner who is my husband in my life. I have two beautiful kids, a girl and a boy. I recently got diagnosed with genital warts. I am so confused, frustrated, sad, angry, worried and stress. My life seems over. I think it will be hard for me to find full happiness again. Genital warts, the ugly stuff, will always be staying in the back of my mine.
I strongly believe in monosex partner in life time and have been practicing my belief. Here I am ended up with a STD.
Silent diseases are easy to ignoreI was first diagnosed with high-risk HPV about a year and a half ago, with the discovery of genital warts on a follow-up visit after biopsy. Even though I consider myself relatively well-informed and compassionate on the subject of STD transmission (i.e. they aren’t necessarily caught due to promiscuous behavior, I didn’t think any less of someone who had one), I wasn’t prepared for the feelings of shame, guilt, and fear I experienced.
Although I tried to go in for a colposcopy as soon as possible, in hindsight I was not emotionally prepared. The doctor, who was highly recommended but simply average at my visit, could not perform a biopsy because I was physically shaking. At the time, I was dealing with graduation from college, a love affair gone wrong, problems with anxiety, and the fact that I now had an STD. The reason many women find putting off treatment a viable option most likely has to do with the fact that their diagnosis is hidden. To this day most of my friends, not to mention my family, do not know that I have been treated for cervical dysplasia and genital warts. Even if a person has every good intention to seek treatment, having to live with a disease as a secret makes it that much more terrifying to admit that, “yes, I have an STD,” when it comes time to make those appointments.
I do not consider myself squeamish or easily intimidated by gynecological exams, but every time I went in to get treated I was overcome with feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. I also moved to a new city in the interim, and it took nearly four months to get all my paperwork in one place even though my boyfriend worked at the institute where my new gynecologist is. I can only imagine how hard it is for everyone who has to get their records in order without professional help.
I would also postulate that because HPV is an invisible epidemic, it is easier to go without treatment. Silent diseases are easy to ignore. Thanks to the work done on AIDS, cancer, and other high-profile diseases, no one would argue that anyone with these diseases should put off treatment. But for ailments such as HPV, thryoid dysfunction, and PMDD (which, interestingly enough, all of whose effects are more prominent or only occur in women), many people go throughout their lives without even a diagnosis, much less full treatment.
Thank you again for providing this valuable resource. Every article or new statistic we have access to allows us to shed a bit more secrecy and come to accept both the fact of having HPV, and preparing ourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally for all necessary treatment.
HPV TestI was twenty three and had not had a pap in over 2 years when I went. My test came back abnormal so I then had to get another test done which was a HPV test and that came back positive. My cells were at a high level for cancer. I had to get my cervix froze hoping it would remove all the abnormal and cancer cells. I had to go back to the doctor three months later to get another test which thankful came back negative. I’m thankful every day that this was detected because I’m not sure what might have happened. Please ask for the test when you get your pap. It can and will save your life.

ASHA works with members of Congress and other important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities. You can help ASHA make the case for sound sexual health policy by contacting your elected officials. Legislators listen to their constituents. Legislators are very interested in effectively articulated concerns expressed by the voters they represent.
The most effective communication remains the personal message, whether by mail, visit, or phone, from a concerned constituent. Click here for points you can make with your elected officials.
You can identify your senators and representatives along with contact information on the Senate and House websites.
Letters
A poll of House and Senate staff members asked what form of communication makes the most impression on them and the legislators for whom they work. The overwhelming response was articulate, thoughtful and timely letters from constituents. Letters should be kept short and to the point. The most effective letters tie the relevant issue to the legislator’s home state or district. If you know how STD funding levels will have a local impact, be sure to include this information in your communication.
Address for letters to Senators:
The Honorable (Name)
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator (last name):
Address for letters to Representatives:
The Honorable (Name)
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Visits
Meeting with a member of Congress or congressional staff is a very effective way to convey a message about a specific legislative issue. Legislators are real people, elected by you to represent your interests. Most are extremely personable and will genuinely enjoy meeting you. Appointments can be arranged by calling or writing the legislator’s district or Washington office. Always identify yourself as a constituent when asking for an appointment. If the legislator is unavailable, the appropriate staff person may offer to meet with you—don’t pass up this opportunity to initiate a relationship.
Tips When Meeting with a Member of Congress
Be Prompt and Patient: When it is time to meet, be punctual and be patient. It is not uncommon for a congressperson to be late, or to have a meeting interrupted, due to the member’s crowded schedule. If interruptions do occur, be flexible. When the opportunity presents itself, continue your meeting with a member’s staff.
Be Prepared: Have your facts lined up prior to the meeting. Whenever possible, bring to the meeting information and materials supporting your position. Always have concisely written documents or clear graphics that reinforce your position and oral presentation.
Assume No Knowledge: Members and staff usually know little or nothing about our issues. Be sure to explain all acronyms, programs, funding sources and which agencies administer the funds.
Localize the Issue: Members of Congress want to represent the best interests of their district or state. Wherever possible, demonstrate the connection between what you are requesting and the interests of the member’s constituency.
Be Responsive: Be prepared to answer questions or provide additional information, in the event the member expresses interest or asks questions.
Ask Questions: Meetings should be seen as two-way streets with a two-way information flow. If possible, take the opportunity to find out where the member and his/her staff stand on our issues.
Follow Up: Follow up the meeting with a thank you letter that outlines the different points covered during the meeting, and send along any additional information and materials requested.
Phone Calls
Unless you have a personal relationship with the legislator you are calling, ask to be referred to the staff member responsible for health issues or funding. Keep in mind that congressional offices receive hundreds of calls each day — be brief and to the point. You can always follow up with more information by mail. To reach any Washington congressional office, phone 202-224-3121 and ask for your legislator by name.

I have a small penis. How can I enlarge it?
Our expert says...Almost all men have a normal size penis – although many young men are concerned that their penis is too short or too small. Sometimes they believe this because they have compared themselves with friends or classmates in a common shower or locker room, or maybe someone teased them or made a hurtful comment. Or they might have seen pornographic pictures or movies and compared themselves with the porno “stars” (many of whom have unusually large genitalia).
The penis reaches adult size over a number of years during puberty (the years during adolescence when boys and girls grow and change to become adult men and women). A boy who matures more slowly than his friends will not get an adult-size penis until late in adolescence – and this may cause anxiety or make him feel as though he has an abnormally small penis.
It is also worth noting that a man’s penis may change size considerably depending on time of day, temperature, and factors other than sexual stimulation or excitement. During sexual stimulation or excitement, the penis becomes engorged with blood and stands erect – but there is a wide variation in normal size and shape and angle for an erect penis also. In some men, the erect penis is almost the same size as the flaccid (soft or non-erect) penis, while in other men the erect penis is much longer and wider than the flaccid penis. You cannot tell by looking at a man’s flaccid penis what size it will be when erect.
As a general rule, the size of the penis does not determine a sexual partner’s satisfaction with a sexual experience. That usually depends much more on the relationship between the two people and on both partners trying to make each sexual experience mutually pleasurable and satisfying for both of them.
Because many young men are concerned about the size of their penis and would like it larger, there are many unethical people or businesses that offer lotions or pills or other types of non-medical treatment to enlarge or lengthen the penis. None of these methods have been fully tested in clinical trials and approved for medical use – and none of them are recommended by reputable physicians. They are taking advantage of a man’s concerns about his penis size (despite the fact that most men have a normal size penis) and seeking to get his money for treatments that are worthless at best. Some can be dangerous or may even damage the penis. None of these methods or products can be recommended or should be used.
Finally, there are a few uncommon medical conditions of the penis that a man should talk about with his doctor (especially a urologist). The first is an extremely small penis, a condition called micropenis in which the penis does not develop to a normal size. Occasionally a boy will also have a penis that does not develop normally even before birth; usually these conditions are recognized shortly after the baby boy is born and given the necessary medical attention. Another medical condition occurring most commonly in middle-aged men is Peyronie’s Disease. In this problem the penis develops scar tissue that may cause it to be smaller or curve abnormally – but this is not a cause of concern about a small or short penis in young men.

I read the study that suggests boys who masturbate are also more likely to use condoms. Why would there be such a connection? And really, doesn’t everyone masturbate?
Our expert says...The exact reason isn’t known for an association between young men’s condom use and masturbation. One simple possibility is that masturbation allows young men to become more familiar with their own penis when it is erect. Using condoms is pretty easy, but knowing what to expect, and some practice, can make it really easy.
Another possibility is that young men who masturbate may be more comfortable with their sexuality. We’ve begun to learn in the past few years that young people who are comfortable with their sexuality are often more careful in protecting themselves and others. It may be that masturbation and condom use are both ways by which people express their sexual health.
A final important point about the study you read is that it shows that people still masturbate even after they’ve started having sex with others. In fact, we know that many men and women continue to masturbate even into their 60’s and 70’s. Even if masturbation isn’t for everyone (isn’t it nice to be able to choose?), it certainly seems that masturbation is a part of people’s expression of their sexuality, no matter how old.

Currently I am 27 years old and I still experience wet dreams. Is this normal?
Click for AnswerDifferent experts define “wet dreams” (or “nocturnal emissions”) slightly differently, so I will start with the broadest possible definition of wet dreams: episodes of lubrication, ejaculation, and/or orgasm during sleep, which may or may not be associated with sexual sensations or dreams. In males, wet dreams are one way the body rids itself of a buildup of seminal fluid and sperm in the testes, prostate and seminal vesicles. In both males and females wet dreams may be sparked by changes in hormones, the physical sensations of one’s genitals rubbing against the sheets, dreams with sexual content, or a full-bladder.
During an average night’s sleep, most males will have several erections, no matter what their age. Not having night-time erections, in fact, is a sign of erectile dysfunction among men past puberty. Similarly, most females will lubricate several times each night. So a more practical definition of a “wet dream” is any experience of lubrication, ejaculation or orgasm which a person happens to notice, either because s/he wakes up during a sexual dream, or because s/he wakes up to a noticeable wet spot on his/her sheets or underwear.
Though the incidence of wet dreams does tend to decrease as people age and/or become sexually active, having wet dreams at age 27 is not uncommon. It is possible that as you get older the frequency of your wet dreams will decrease over time, though some sexually healthy men and women continue having (and even enjoying) them for their entire lives.
If your night time experiences are distressing for you, you might try masturbating more often or before bed in order to see if that affects your rate of nocturnal emissions. Many people report that when they increase the amount of sex which they have during the day—either partnered or solo—they have fewer noticeable wet dreams at night, though others notice no difference in frequency. Since frequent orgasm is correlated with increased lifespan, strong immune system, and a decreased risk of heart disease and some kinds of cancer, making masturbation part of your daily routine is likely to have a positive effect on your health, whether or not it affects the frequency of your wet dreams.
Some men experience wet dreams as one symptom of what is sometimes termed “premature ejaculation,” which simply means that they ejaculate during sex more quickly than they and/or their partners would hope. If this is the case for you, read the Q&A about premature ejaculation on this page.
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I am an 18 year old male. Every time I lay with my girlfriend and hold her I get an erection and prematurely ejaculate. I don’t get an orgasm from it, all I feel is the wetness in my pants. I’m so ashamed of it that I won’t have sex because I don’t want her to know. I lost my last girlfriend because of this. Is there anything I can do to prevent this? Is there something wrong with me? Will I grow out of this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone about this issue.
Our expert says...The short answer to your question is that there are no negative effects of masturbation. That means in terms of mental health, physical health, sexual health.
The first question to ask is whether or not you are actually ejaculating. It may possible that the wetness in your pants is a generous amount of pre-ejaculate or “pre-cum,” the natural, clear lubrication secreted into the urethra and out through the tip when a man is aroused. Some men produce very little pre-ejaculate, while others can produce around a teaspoon, certainly enough to make your underwear feel wet. You cannot control the amount of pre-cum, but you take comfort in the fact that all men secrete pre-ejaculate and that your body is doing its job well.
If you are ejaculating prematurely—before you want to—you should know that this is quite common as well. Is there anything wrong with you? Probably not, though I certainly recommend talking with your healthcare provider. Certain anti-depressants can inhibit sexual arousal, and your healthcare provider will know whether this option might be appropriate for you. Will you grow out of it? Probably so. Most estimates suggest that about a third of men have some challenges with ejaculatory control, and that most of those men grow out of the difficulty as they age.
The ability to control ejaculation is not a skill anyone is born with; it is one every man has to learn. When you were a young child you learned to control urination. You have probably also learned how to control sneezing, or at least to moderate how loudly you sneeze when you are in a quiet environment. Ejaculation, like urination and sneezing, is a physical reflex, and learning to control it takes practice, experimentation and experience, along with a willingness to make mistakes along the way.
The fact that you recognize the difference between orgasm and ejaculation means you already have a high level of body-awareness. The techniques that are most often suggested for increasing ejaculatory control simply build on this strength you already possess: awareness of your physical reactions.
I caution you against trying to think about a non-sexual topic in order to avoid feeling sexual. Distracting yourself during physical contact with someone you care about is a hard habit to break and ultimately tends to create more problems than it fixes. If your goal is to be able to focus on your girlfriend and your own physical pleasures while also controlling ejaculation, then distracting your mind takes you further away from that goal rather than toward it.
I suggest that first you practice controlling ejaculation on your own while masturbating, using the “squeeze” technique or the “stop/start” technique, both which will give you practice in recognizing signals from your body, allowing you to enjoy sexual sensations and get close to ejaculation without going past the “point of no return,” when ejaculation becomes inevitable. Resources to help you learn about these techniques are listed below.
In addition, masturbate to orgasm and ejaculation (once or more) before your dates with your girlfriend. Having already experienced sexual release may slow down your responses once the two of you are together.
I also suggest you talk to your girlfriend about what’s happening for you if you feel you can trust that she will keep this information in confidence. It may be flattering for her to learn that she turns you on so much, and simply sharing this information might help you decrease your anxiety and embarrassment. Anxiety about ejaculatory control may actually make it more difficult to moderate ejaculation. Once your difficulty is out in the open, you can work together modify the techniques you’ve been practicing on your own. The DVD and most descriptions of the practice techniques assume couples are having intercourse, but you can modify the same principles to fit your relationship.
For example, the two of you might experiment this way: See how close you can sit to each other before you get an erection. Slowly practice moving closer to each other and touching each other—first holding hands, then wrapping an arm around her, then allowing her to put her head on your chest. How long and in what ways can you touch before you feel like you are close to ejaculating? At that point, before you reach the “point of no return,” move further apart or stop touching until you are ready to try again. With practice, you will likely be able to hold her more closely for longer periods of time.
If you ejaculate before you are ready, don’t worry. Just laugh, go change your underwear (keep several pairs on hand for such occasions), and return to snuggling, knowing that controlling ejaculation will most likely get easier over time as you practice with patience and self-acceptance.

I have been masturbating for several years. What effect could it have on my physical and sexual health?
Our expert says...The short answer to your question is that there are no negative effects of masturbation. That means in terms of mental health, physical health, sexual health.
In fact, masturbation is such an important part of our sexuality that it appears to be universal. It is practiced by younger as well as older people, and often by people having other sorts of sex as well. Examples of masturbation can be found in sculptures and art from ancient times, and we know that animals masturbate. Masturbation is not just common in humans, but appears to be innate to us. Innate behaviors often have positive health benefits, which allows them to be passed along in time and shared among species. For example, studies from non-human primates (who also masturbate) show that masturbation helps maintain healthy sperm counts. So, I think it is something that is innate to us as human beings, as part of the gift of our sexuality.
Probably the most negative effect of masturbation is worry or guilt about it. I think a lot of people wonder about masturbation because of things heard from others or because of jokes people tell. Sometime people get the idea that only certain kinds of sex are “normal.” However, it is completely accurate to say that masturbation is one of many normal ways by which people explore and express their sexuality.
–J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, MS
I’m the parent of a pre-teen. I want to know how to broach the subject of sex and STIs with my child. How do I start? What are the main topics I should cover?
Our expert says...Talking to your children about sex is something that almost every parent thinks about. Especially when their child (or their child’s friends) start showing signs of puberty.
Here are some points to consider in getting yourself ready.
1. It’s not just one “talk.”
You want your teen to understand that sex isn’t simple so you shouldn’t expect to cover everything in one “talk.” Relationships, love, the mechanics of sex, the feelings of sex, the good parts of sex, the dangerous parts of sex…these are all things that require attention, probably more than once.
There are two other important things to remember. First, the fact that you are talking at all is the most important part of helping your child grow up. Exactly what is said, and when, may be less important than talking itself.
Second, listening to your child may be as important as talking. Paying attention to what your child is talking about in other conversations, or watching on television, may give you useful opportunities to engage the issues around sex. As you do this, don’t mistake apparent lack of attention for lack of interest.
2. Prepare yourself
It’s probably a good idea to prepare yourself to talk to your child about sex. You have your own values and experiences that have shaped you: it may be useful to review those before talking to your child. That process may also be helpful in clarifying your hopes and expectations for your child as a sexual person.
It may help to think about the type of language you want to use. Very few people use formal anatomic language in discussions about sex with others. On the other hand, much of our informal language about sex is considered vulgar. Thinking through the words you can be comfortable with helps express your comfort with the topic to your child.
Finally, do some homework. There are lots of inexpensive resources for parents. For example, Beyond the Big Talk: Every Parent’s Guide to Raising Sexually Healthy Teens–From Middle School to High School and Beyond by Debra W. Haffner.
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy has guides in both English and Spanish for parents wanting to help their teen delay sex and be sexually healthy.
3. Look for opportunities to talk
Parents are sometimes so uncomfortable in talking about sex that they attempt to “schedule” a talk. There are lots of circumstances–watching television, listening to news, reviewing homework, riding to practices–when some talk about sex would be appropriate to the context.
–J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, MS
What is foreplay?
Our expert says...“Foreplay” is generally defined as any sexual or romantic activity that prepares someone for intercourse. Kissing, hugging, petting, oral sex, manual stimulation (such as fingering), bondage/discipline/S&M (such as spanking), a romantic dinner, dating, sexual teasing, watching or reading porn/erotica, and talking all can be “foreplay” if partners become aroused (“turned on”).
For intercourse to be comfortable, a man’s penis needs to be engorged with blood (“hard”), and a woman’s vagina needs to be self-lubricated (“wet”). Often people get aroused at different rates, so you should have enough foreplay before intercourse to make sure everyone’s ready. If a woman tries to have intercourse when her vagina is not lubricated, for example, it can be uncomfortable or even painful for her.
If you have anal intercourse, foreplay should involve both getting turned on and relaxing the muscles of the anus of the person(s) who will be receptive. Because the anus does not self-lubricate, you’ll need to use lubricant any time that you have anal intercourse (or insert fingers).
Sometimes men or women do not become erect or lubricated, even when they feel good and are enjoying sex. A person’s age, physical health, hormone levels, monthly cycles, drug use, emotions, recent sexual activity, and comfort level with a particular partner can all affect blood flow to the genitals, and therefore may affect erections and lubrication. It is possible to add extra lubrication (water-based lubricant, silicone-based lube, saliva [spit], or vegetable oil [NOT with latex condoms]) if needed, and fortunately there are many fun sexual activities which are not focused on the genitals (penis, vagina) at all.
The word “foreplay” implies that intercourse is the “main event,” the ultimate goal of sex. It’s not, or it doesn’t have to be. We can have hot, steamy sex with or without intercourse. Scientists who study sexuality have learned that many of us can have orgasms from stimulation to almost any place on our bodies—breasts, necks, noses, feet, ears, knees—anywhere!
Some have suggested replacing the term “foreplay” with “outercourse.” Whatever you call it, I’d suggest that you can think of all of those fabulous activities I listed (and more) as part of—rather than simply a prelude to—sex.
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I am a 64 year-old-woman, and I’ve been divorced for many years. More and more I find myself thinking about being with other women. I have only been with men, and I feel riddled with guilt by these urges. But I’m also excited about the thought of exploring them. How do I know if I am a lesbian or bisexual? What do I do?
Our expert says...“Sexual orientation” describes one’s pattern of sexual and/or romantic attraction to men, women, both genders, neither gender, or any gender expression in between. Though LGBTQ (lesbian, gay bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning) people still face social, political, and religious prejudice, today’s culture is generally more accepting of LGBTQ people than it was even a few decades ago. People who repressed or were not aware of their sexual feelings toward people of their same gender are now “coming out” as LGBTQ. Older adults who are curious about same-sex feelings are increasingly giving themselves permission to explore their attractions.
“Sexual orientation” also refers to the label one chooses to describe him/her/hirself. The labels lesbian, bisexual, straight, gay, homosexual, heterosexual, pansexual, and asexual are all examples of labels which may describe an aspect of one’s self-identity. One’s label does not necessarily reflect behavior, however. Some people who self-identify as heterosexual occasionally have sex with people of their own gender. Some who self-identify as homosexual occasionally have sex with people of a different gender. You get to choose the label that feels right to you.
Many people find that their sexual orientation (both pattern of attraction and self-identifying label) is fluid, sometimes changing multiple times over a lifetime. During one phase of life people might be primarily attracted to those of a different gender; during another someone might be attracted primarily to those of one’s own gender.
As you explore these feelings, I encourage you to find support either online or in your local community at an LGBT(Q) Community Center or a Gay and Lesbian Retirement Center.

I am a woman and I like watching porn…a lot. Is there something wrong with me?
Our expert says...Many women and men enjoy and get aroused by watching other people have sex. You are likely to enjoy some porn but not others. Some people, for example, like only porn that looks realistic—in which the orgasms look real and the actors seem to really enjoy each other (“have chemistry”). Some like porn with a story-line; others prefer to skip the story and get straight to the visual images of sex. Some people like close-ups of genitals and other body parts; others like watching the actors’ faces or entire bodies.
You might like to watch porn alone while masturbating, with a partner before or during sex, or both. Watching porn may help you learn what kind of sex you might like to try, but keep in mind that a lot of porn is not terribly realistic. For example, you will rarely see porn actors lubricating their anuses on-screen, but we all need lots of lubricant to be able to have anal sex without injuring ourselves!
In addition, watching pornography or fantasizing about a certain kind of sex does not necessarily mean you want to engage in that kind of sex “in real life.” Sometimes people enjoy watching sex that they wouldn’t actually want to have themselves.
Some people object to pornography for religious, political, or other reasons. If porn makes you feel uncomfortable for any reason, it is absolutely fine to avoid it. If you enjoy it, however, you are in good company.
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I am a straight, single woman who has not had a partner for years, and I am extremely frustrated by the lack of sexual contact. I masturbate frequently and recently have even watched a few pornographic videos while doing so. But I feel guilty, that buying or renting porn supports an industry that exploits people for their bodies. The thought of men purchasing the bodies of young women sickens me, for example, but am I really so different, paying money for these videos? Is there “woman-friendly” porn you might recommend?
Our expert says...NOTE: THE LINKS INCLUDED IN THIS REsPONSE WILL DIRECT YOU TO SITES THAT INCLUDE ADULT-ONLY CONTENT. CLICK ON THESE LINKS ONLY IF YOU ARE OF THE LEGAL AGE OF CONSENT IN YOUR STATE AND ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT APPROPRIATE FOR THE VIEWING OF ADULT CONTENT (LINKS ARE NSFW).

I think it is great that you are empowering yourself to seek out sexual entertainment that you both enjoy and feel good about. It sounds like you want erotica that neither violates someone’s privacy nor was made by people coerced, tricked, or forced to participate. Unfortunately, human rights violations happen in many industries, including sex. As a consumer it can be difficult to determine from watching a film or looking at a photograph whether an actor or actress made an active and informed choice to be there. Some women and men, for example, are highly aroused by and knowledgeably consent to being sexually humiliated, experiencing pain, or role-playing non-consensual sex, so it is generally impossible to determine from the content what motivated an actor’s/actress’s participation.
“Woman friendly” porn made by women and/or with a female consumer in mind is widely available, as is porn in which the actor/actress shares directly with the viewer about his/her/hir experiences. Keep in mind that the sexual tastes of both men and women vary widely, however, so don’t get discouraged if it takes some searching to find porn that satisfies both your erotic pleasures and your ethical standards. One place to start is Violet Blue’s resource Porn for Women.
You may find it useful to explore your thoughts and feelings about sex work, as well as cultural judgments around sexuality and the body. For example, what does it mean to exploit someone for his/her body, and how is that different from paying someone to perform a physical act that one enjoys or finds useful (sex, athletics, cleaning, construction, surgery, music, dance)? You may find some questions to ponder in my article, Sexual Embodiment Practice: Porn (2007). Consider Violet Blue’s perspective on porn in, Our Porn, Our Selves and the sex-positive, pro-porn campaign (2010).
Here are some smart, self-aware women in adult film (and other sex work) whose perspectives may also be of interest:
Carol Queen, PhD: sex writer, speaker, educator, activist, filmmaker, and former sex worker. Her book, Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture is an excellent resource which challenges some of the popular societal ideas about sexuality and sex work.
Tristan Taormino’s Pucker Up: sex information, porn and sexually-explicit educational videos
Annie Sprinkle, PhD: former porn star and prostitute, sexuality educator, artist, and lecturer
Audacia Ray: former sex worker, educator, and writer. Her book, Naked on the Internet, explores the role the internet has played in women’s sexual exploration and expressions as well as the role women have had in building a sexual space on the internet.
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I’m a 22-year-old guy, and I feel really embarrassed. I can’t get a hard on, or if I get one it goes away before I come. I feel like this shouldn’t be happening to me since I am so young. Isn’t this a problem for older men?
Our expert says...Men of any age can sometimes find it difficult to get or maintain erections. Few of us have bodies that always “perform” exactly as we want them to, and it is perfectly normal for erections to come and go during any period of sexual play.
If you’re concerned about your ability to get an erection, I would suggest that you first see a physician to rule out medical problems. Your doctor will likely ask you questions such as:
Do you get erections in your sleep? When masturbating alone? With a partner?
Do you drink alcohol, use recreational drugs, or take prescription medications?
Alcohol and other drugs sometimes make people feel less nervous about sex, but they can get in the way of being able to get and maintain erections. Some prescription drugs have sexual side-effects, and some medical conditions affect erections, as well.
If your doctor rules out medical causes, you might want to explore mental or emotional reasons that you are having trouble getting and maintaining erections.
Are you attracted to your partner(s)?
Do you feel nervous, anxious, or guilty about sex? About getting an erection? About pleasing your partner(s)?
Do you know and trust your partner(s) well enough so that you feel comfortable around him or her?
If you are anxious, nervous, or feel guilty about getting an erection or having sex, this can make it more difficult to get turned on physically. Your penis might be “shy,” even when your mind is aroused, especially if you feel pressure to “perform” sexually, you don’t know your partner(s) well, or if something happened in the past which left you feeling that an erection was unsafe or morally unacceptable.
Because our culture tends to have narrow ideas about what it means to be attractive, you may need to take some time to figure out what it is that attracts you. Do you enjoy looking at, smelling, touching and talking to this person, whether or not s/he looks like the ideal in your head? Would you prefer to be having sex with someone of another gender? Do you like and respect your partner(s)? Do they like and respect you? Many men find that they need to know, trust, and feel very attracted to their partner(s) before they can maintain erections with them.
I would also suggest you explore ways of giving and receiving sexual pleasure without an erection. Your hands and mouth can give someone a lot of pleasure, and every inch of our skin is sensitive to touch. (See more on foreplay above)
You may consider talking with a counselor or therapist who specializes in sexual issues, such as those at:
The American Association of Sexual Educators, Counselors and Therapists
The Society for Sex Therapy and Research
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I started masturbating in childhood and I am not able to stop. Will there be problem if continue to do it? I do it practically every day.
Our expert says...There are many benefits of sexual activity-both partnered sex and masturbation, also called “solo sex.” In fact, frequent orgasms are correlated with:
Longer life-span
Stronger immune system
Decreased risk of heart disease and prostate problems in men
Decreased risk of breast cancer and endometriosis in women
Orgasms may help you fall asleep, relieve menstrual cramps, relieve migraines and other physical pain, increase genital muscle tone, decrease stress, and increase a sense of well-being. Plus, they are fun!
Masturbation is also a way for you to learn about your own sexual responses. If you learn about the kinds of sensations you enjoy while masturbating, you can better communicate with a partner the types of activities that give you pleasure (and which don’t).
Masturbation doesn’t need to stop when you have a partner, however. Many people find that even when they are having regular, satisfying partnered sex that they still enjoy masturbating alone. Some people enjoy masturbating to fantasies of their partner. Masturbation is simply different from–not “less” than–partnered sex.
You may also want to try “mutual masturbation”, each person giving him/her/hirself pleasure in the company of others. It’s a great “safer sex” technique and can be very hot watching someone else get off. You may learn new techniques to pleasure yourself or a partner(s) by watching others masturbate.
There are some occasions when a person may want to avoid masturbation. If a couple is trying to get pregnant, doctors often recommend that the man should refrain from ejaculating for 24 hours or more so that he can conserve sperm for intercourse. After certain surgeries or injuries, the strong muscle contractions of orgasms can cause problems. Talk to your doctor if you think there may be any medical reason to avoid masturbating.
Sometimes people report feeling like their masturbation is compulsive (that they can’t stop). If masturbation gets in the way of life activities such as school or work, if you are masturbating without any enjoyment or satisfaction, or if you are chafed or bleeding, your masturbation may be problematic for you. Otherwise, continue enjoying masturbating as much as you like.

I’d like your thoughts on the morality of using prostitutes. I’m no prude and am all for consenting adults doing what they want, but I worry about exploiting someone who is probably engaging in commercial sex work for a host of reasons that don’t involve really wanting to do it. Can anyone ever be a sex worker by choice, rather than coercion of some type? I realize I’m asking your permission to “go for it” and even feel guilty about that!
Our expert says...
In the United States there are few places where you can legally pay for sex. Though I won’t encourage you to break the law, I can provide you with information about sex work.
“Sex work” includes both legal and illegal forms of sexual entertainment, including “peep show” performance, erotic dance, pornography, phone sex, and prostitution. The reasons for choosing sex work are as complex and varied as those for any other field of work. While some sex workers have few job opportunities because of limited time, socioeconomic status, family obligations, and/or education, many sex workers—including those with socioeconomic and educational privilege–actively choose sex work from among a wider range of opportunities.
The prevailing myth that most prostitutes are forced or coerced into prostitution is unsubstantiated by evidence and probably reveals more about negative cultural attitudes regarding sex than it does the actual lives of sex workers themselves. A report by the Sex Workers Project and Urban Justice Center of New York, titled Sex Worker Myths vs. Reality, reports that, “In a July 2006 study, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that current estimates of the number of people trafficked into any kind of work, including sex work, were questionable.”
There are almost certainly prostitutes who would prefer to be doing other work, just as there are teachers, doctors, and trash collectors who don’t find their work fulfilling. Unfortunately, prostitutes can get “locked into” sex work by threat of legal punishment and social stigma if attempting to change their line of work. Writing “prostitute” on a job application could not only cost someone a job, but ensure they were arrested as well, in spite of the fact that being a successful sex worker requires many transferrable job skills, including customer service, marketing, advertising, communication, and financial management skills.

Note: To reduce your risk of an unplanned pregnancy or contracting or transmitting an STI, no matter who your sexual partner(s) is, please remember to use barriers such as condoms each time you have sex. Read more about how to assess and reduce your sexual risks in ASHA’s Sexual Health sections on reducing sexual risk and the safer sex toolbox.
–Amy Stapleford, M.Ed.
I am a girl and I look up pictures of boobs and videos of lesbians sometimes. I am somehow attracted to boobs and I think they look good, although I never feel attracted to girls. Does that mean I am a lesbian?
Our expert saysThe short and easy answer is, no: enjoying looking at breasts or lesbian erotica does not mean you are a lesbian. Someone is a lesbian if she calls herself a lesbian, and usually that means she is primarily attracted sexually, romantically and emotionally to women and rarely if ever attracted to men.
In fact, many other self-identified heterosexual women enjoy looking at other women’s bodies. I once heard a woman refer to herself jokingly as a “boob-isexual.” She has always been attracted romantically, emotionally and sexually to men. She finds breasts arousing and attractive but has never wanted to be in a sexual or romantic relationship with a woman.
Most sexologists and psychologists agree that few people are exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. Most people, they say, fall somewhere on a continuum between gay and straight, and most people’s “sexual orientation” is fluid (changeable) over a lifetime. We humans are marvelously complex, and simple labels like “straight” and “gay” don’t account for our infinite diversity.
Alfred Kinsey is one scientist whose research suggested that people do not typically fall into the neat and easy categories of “heterosexual” and “homosexual.” He developed a scale from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual) with which to describe one’s sexual orientation. You can read more about the “Kinsey Scale” online.
Similarly, many people don’t think of attraction as a simple “either/or”: “I am either attracted to someone or I am not.” Instead they think of the many different ways they might be attracted to someone—whether for going on a hike, looking at someone, having a conversation, having non-genital sex, having genital sex, having children, or sharing a home. By asking themselves “the ways in which” they are attracted to someone instead of “whether or not” they are attracted to someone, they find they are “attracted” to many people in different ways and for different types of activities: some sexual, others not.
Using an expanded idea about what it means to be attracted to someone, it sounds like you may be “attracted to” looking at breasts and watching girls having sex with each other, but not attracted to having sex with girls yourself–a perfectly valid set of interests.

The Health Is Power toolkit is designed for organizations to better promote sexual health among young African American men (ages 18-30). The toolkit is designed mainly for heterosexual men, but also includes imagery and messaging that can be used with gay and bisexual men.
The creative concepts and messaging used with Health is Power were developed through a number of activities including formative research (literature review, expert panel meeting, and research with the target audience). A national survey done with more than 500 African American adults found the Health is Power concept connected strongly with heterosexual, gay, and bisexual men.
The objective of Health is Power is to promote positive sexual health behaviors through a multi-phased campaign with messaging around 1) increased condom use; 2) healthy relationships; 3) sexually transmitted disease prevention; and 4) open partner communication. Each phase of the campaign is designed to run between 2-4 week (although organizations should use the materials in a manner that best fits their needs).
Toolkit materials you can download include:
Customizable posters and postcards
Sample social media content, including Facebook posts, Tweets, images, cover images, and profile image
Web banners
Sample “Drop-in” website articles
The Increasing Importance of Social Media
According to the Pew Research Center (2014, 2015), African American adults are active on social media, with 67% of them on Facebook, 38% on Instagram, 28% on LinkedIn and 27% on Twitter. Youth (ages 18-29 years) are especially avid consumers of social media, with 87% on Facebook, 53% on Instagram, 37% on Twitter and 23% on LinkedIn.
Your agency can customize these materials with your own logo and by adding links to relevant information, resources, services or events your organization offers. We’re proud to support your good work in getting out the word that Health is Power!
Simply click here and fill in your organization name and email address to get instant access to the complete toolkit including customizable postcards, posters and banners.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

Volunteer Spotlight
NJ Chapter Leader Sandy Fischer, second from left, and chapter volunteers gear up for the chapter’s annual Halloween 5K.
Sandy Cowan Fischer, current chapter leader of the NCCC New Jersey Chapter in Montclair, has worked tirelessly to help spread awareness about cervical cancer prevention and the importance of early detection. The New Jersey Chapter was originally founded by Cristina Lucchetti Ryan in memory of her best friend, CaryAnne Cowan, a mother and life-long New Jersey resident who lost her life to cervical cancer in 2007. CaryAnne’s sister Sandy became involved with the New Jersey Chapter in 2009 and as chapter leader has done incredible work to raise awareness and spread the word about cervical cancer prevention. The New Jersey Chapter’s signature event, its annual 5K Halloween fundraiser, has helped the chapter raise funds to promote its educational efforts and, most significantly, allowed the chapter to award $5,000 to a local health center to support free Pap tests for women in need.
Thank you, Sandy, and all of the NJ Chapter volunteers for your efforts to prevent cervical cancer and save lives!

Human papillomavirus is a common infection—more than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives. But HPV vaccines can help prevent infection from both high-risk HPV types that can lead to cervical cancer and low-risk types that cause genital warts.
In the U.S., HPV infections cause over 20,000 cancers in women, and over 13,000 cancers in men each year. HPV vaccines can help prevent HPV-related cancer. Maria Trent, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, knows the importance of vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV). She shares her experiences treating HPV disease and explains why vaccination is “a gift” for our children.
HPV vaccination is recommended for girls and boys ages 11-12. The vaccine produces a stronger immune response when taken during the preteen years. For this reason, up until age 14, only two doses are the vaccine are required. In late 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil-9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26. For those 15 and older, however, a full three-dose series is needed.
Rates of infection with strains of HPV covered by the vaccines have dropped significantly since the vaccine was introduced. Researchers comparing HPV infections rates among females ages 14-19 in years before (2003-2006) and after (2007-2010) the first HPV vaccine became available found a 56% drop in infection rates for the HPV types covered by the vaccine. As more young people receive the vaccine, these rates can continue to drop. As of 2017, almost half (49 percent) of adolescents were up to date on the HPV vaccine, and 66 percent of adolescents ages 13-17 years received the first dose to start the vaccine series).
FAQs
Why are HPV vaccines important?
HPV is very common. Most sexually active people have HPV at some point in their lives. The infection is usually harmless and the body most often clears it in a short time.
HPV can lead to cervical cancer. Some types of HPV can infect a woman’s cervix and cause the cells to change. Most of the time, HPV goes away on its own. When HPV is gone, the cervix cells go back to normal. But sometimes, HPV does not go away. In a few people, high-risk HPV and related cervical cell changes last for many years and can lead to cancer if they aren’t found. Being vaccinated against HPV can lower the chance a woman will develop cervical cancer.
HPV can cause other types of cancer. Some types of HPV can cause cancers of the penis, anus, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils).
Low-risk types of HPV can cause genital warts.The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer. Genital warts may cause problems during pregnancy.
How many doses are required?
Youth between ages 9 and 14 only need two doses of the HPV vaccine. The schedule calls for the second dose of the vaccine to be given 6-12 months following the first. Studies show the antibody response generated with the 2-dose regimen is not inferior to that observed with the three doses previously recommended for all age groups.
For older teens and adults who start the series later, aged 15 through 45, three doses are still required. In this case, the second shot should be given one to two months after the first, and the third shot should be given six months after the first. The goal is to get all three shots within six months.
Ideally, people should complete all doses of the vaccine before they become sexually active. However, those who are eligible and are sexually active should still get the vaccine.
Are HPV vaccines safe?HPV vaccines have been used in many countries around the world for several years, and both vaccines appear to be safe and well tolerated. There have been some mild to moderate reactions reported from people who have received the vaccines, the most common of which is pain, redness, and swelling around where the shot was given. Other mild reactions reported include fever, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Some people have experienced fainting as well.
As with any vaccine or medication, there is always a possible of a serious problem, such allergic reaction. However, such reactions are rare and HPV vaccine continue to be monitored for any safety concerns.
Is the HPV vaccine mandatory for school enrollment?Each state decides whether or not to require vaccinations for enrollment in childcare or school attendance.
According to the National Conference for State Legislators (NCSL), legislators in at least 42 states and D.C. have introduced legislation to require the vaccine, fund or educate the public about the HPV vaccine since 2006, and at least 22 states have enacted legislation. Currently, only Virginia and the District of Columbia have requirements for HPV vaccination for school. However, parents can opt out of vaccination requirements.
See the NCSL website for up to date, state-specific information.
Does insurance pay for the vaccine?The vast majority of health insurance plans report including most or all of the ACIP recommended vaccines in their benefits for children adolescents and adults.
For those that qualify, HPV vaccines are also available through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The VFC program provides free vaccinations for children aged 18 and under who meet at least one of the following criteria: 1) Medicaid eligible; 2) uninsured; 3) underinsured; or 4) Native American or Alaska Native. More information on the VFC program is available here.
Do HPV vaccines to lead to increased sexual behavior?While some parents have expressed a concern that vaccinating their children against HPV will lead to increased sexual behavior, several studies have shown this not to be the case. While many studies relied upon self-reported behavior about sexual activity, a 2012 study published in the journal Pediatrics instead looked at medical data, including pregnancy, sexually transmitted infection testing or diagnosis, and contraceptive counseling as evidence of sexually activity. The researchers found that HPV vaccination in the recommended ages was not associated with increased sexual activity.
Do females who receive the HPV vaccine still need to get regular Pap tests?Yes! HPV vaccines will not eliminate all HPV or cervical cancer. The vaccines prevent the HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancer cases, but there are other types of HPV (not covered in the vaccine) that could cause disease.
In addition to regular Pap tests, women 30 and over can also request an HPV test along with their Pap. Unlike a Pap test, which only detects abnormal cell changes, an HPV test can be used to find one or more of the high-risk types of HPV that are most commonly found with cervical cancer. Most women under 30 with HPV will get rid of the virus, so the HPV test for younger women isn’t helpful.

Search this websiteDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

The quality of your sex life affects your entire life. So, if you’re having a hard time enjoying or desiring sex it’s important to find out why. There are a number of reasons for this, such as culture, background, and past sexual experiences. Emotional, physical, and psychological factors can affect intimacy and sex, too. These can include:
Relationship problems
Depression, anxiety, and stress
Age-related changes
Hormone changes
Certain medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis
Medication side effects (for instance, from medicines used to treat depression, anxiety, and blood pressure)
Troubles with having sex or enjoying it are sometimes called female sexual dysfunction or female sexual difficulties (FSD). It can be life-long or can develop over time. FSD is defined as persistent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm, or pain that causes you distress or strains your relationship with your partner. While every woman deserves a fulfilling sex life, more than 40% of women will have sexual difficulties at some point in their lives.
There are four main types of FSD:
Low sexual desire. Lack of interest in sex and sexual activity.
Sexual arousal disorder. Difficulty in becoming aroused or lack of sexual response during sexual activity.
Orgasmic disorder. Consistent difficulty (or inability) to reach orgasm.
Sexual pain disorder. Pain during intercourse (called dyspareunia) or with vaginal stimulation.
Many women experience one or more of these problems at one point or another, from trouble reaching orgasm or just not feeling “in the mood.” But for some women, these problems are ongoing and can affect a woman’s sense of well being and relationships.
The good news is that these problems can be treated. While there’s no magic bullet promising a quick and easy cure, there are ways to deal with sexual difficulties. The first step is to look at the possible causes.
Causes
Physical/biological: There are a number of physicial conditions that can affect a woman’s sexual response and reduce pleasure and satisfaction. For example, conditions such as thyroid disease and diabetes can result in reduced vaginal lubrication which can make sex uncomfortable and less satisfying. Hormonal issues, such low estrogen levels, can also reduce lubrication and thin the vaginal lining, while lowered testosterone levels can lower the sex drive.
A decreased sex drive can also be the result of certain medications, including drugs to control blood pressure and some antidepressants, and can make it difficult for a woman to reach orgasm. Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or vaginitis can all make sex uncomfortable or even painful, as can vaginal infections, pelvic surgery or bowel difficulties.
Psychological/emotional: A woman’s sexual response involves not just the body but the mind, of course, and emotional factors play a role in sexual satisfaction. Anxiety, depression, and simply the stresses of everyday life can contribute to sexual problems, as can problems in a relationship. Issues with body image as well as religious and/or cultural factors can also contribute.
Listen to ASHA’s three-part conversation with sociologist and sexual health expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz on female sexual difficulties. She discusses the range of female sexual difficulties, the impact of sexual difficulties on a relationship, and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You can listen on ASHA’s website or via iTunes.
Sometimes the issues that lead to sexual problems are temporary – such as stress or medication use – and can be resolved easily. But when does the occasional difficulty become a real problem? If difficulties are ongoing and causing distress, then it may be time to seek help.
Finding Help
A healthcare provider can help you figure out what might be behind the difficulties you’re experiencing and find ways to resolve the problem. Your provider will likely ask you about:
your medical history
any medications or supplements you may take
your sexual history
current and past relationships
Depending on your symptoms and concerns, she or he may do a pelvic exam to look for signs of infection or irritation or perhaps a pelvic ultrasound to identify any anatomical issues. If psychological issues seem to be the principle cause of the problem, your provider may offer a referral to a counselor.
If your problem has a hormonal cause, such as low estrogen or a thyroid deficiency, the provider may suggest a medical treatment option. She or he might also suggest adjusting or changing your current medication whose side effects may be causing your symptoms. But there are also non-medical options that can help.
Communication: Talk to your partner about your concerns and problems you are having and what your needs are. A caring partner will be willing to work with you to find solutions.
Experiment: Sometimes trying something new can help. For example, if pain is an issue, try new positions to discover what might be more comfortable. To address a lack of arousal or trouble reaching orgasm, you might spend more time on foreplay, explore sensual massage, or experiment with vibrators or other sex toys to see what you find pleasurable. The Sinclair Institute is one resource that offers sexual health products for adults.
Lubrication: Vaginal dryness can make sex uncomfortable, even painful. While this can be a result of different problem and medications, is it also a common problem among post-menopausal women. Using lubricants can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable. For some women, local hormonal therapy, such as an estrogen cream, might be recommended by a provider.
Talk with a professional: A counselor or therapist who specializes in sexuality and sexual problems can help both you and your partner better understand your sexual problems and offer and strategies to improve intimacy. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) allows you to search for a sex therapist or counselor in your area.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Search this websiteSTID? The Case for a New Term
ASHA was founded in 1914 as the American Social Hygiene Association. By 1959 that name seemed dated so ASHA became the American Social Health Association, a moniker we kept until we rang in 2013 by becoming the American Sexual Health Association.
Times change and our language and terminology need the occasional dusting off (perhaps reboot is more appropriate in 2016?). Another case in point from our sexual health field: the term VD (for venereal disease) eventually was replaced by STD which, in turn, is often playing second fiddle to STI (read our explanation of all this here). Do we perhaps need a more precise term?
Click here to read Dr. Anderson’s essay on STD, STI, and STID.
In her paper “STD (sexually transmitted disease) or STI (sexually transmitted infection): Should we choose?” medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID)” as a more accurate way to refer these infections or diseases or…well, you read her paper and let us know what you think.
Do we need a new term for a new era and is STID the way to go? Send your comments to us via email and we’ll publish selected musings on the subject.

FDA Approves HPV Vaccine for Adults Over 26
October 8, 2018
On October 5, 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26. Gardasil 9 prevents infections with the “high risk” HPV types most commonly found in a number of cancers worldwide, including cervical cancer. The vaccine also protects against “low risk” HPV types associated with most cases of genital warts.
HPV infections are common and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 14 million Americans are diagnosed with HPV each year. While most HPV infections are harmless and clear naturally, the sheer number of cases make it a key public health priority. In the U.S. about 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year and the burden is much higher globally. “High risk” HPV types also are associated with vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, and many head and neck cancers.
To learn more about the HPV vaccine check out the FDA’s press announcement.

The Female Condom Gets a New Name
September 27, 2018
Good news for sexual health advocates: in a final order issued today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the classification of female condoms from a class III device to a lower-risk class II device—the same classification shared by male condoms. The change will make it easier for manufacturers to bring the product to market, as the regulatory requirements for a class II device are lower than for the class III.
The order also includes a new name for the product. The “single-use female condom” will now be called the “single-use internal condom,” reflecting its potential use during anal sex—a new indication for the product. Currently, only one female condom—the FC2 Female Condom—is available in the U.S., and it is sold by prescription. For those without insurance, it is also available for purchase online through the manufacturer, and may be available for patients at health departments or clinics. This new FDA ruling classifies the
single-use
internal condom as an over-the-counter (OTC) device, opening the door for greater access.
“The device is assigned the generic name single-use internal condom, and it is identified as an OTC sheath-like device that lines the vaginal or anal
wall and is inserted into the
vagina or anus prior to the initiation
of
coitus. At the conclusion of coitus, it is removed and discarded. It is indicated for contraception and/or
prophylactic (preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted
infections) purposes.”
The reclassification comes after years of advocacy efforts seeking the change to help improve access. This is reflected in the public comments to the FDA in support of the change. As the FDA order notes,
the “overwhelming
majority of commenters supported the proposed reclassification,
name change, and the general effort to increase patient access to single-use internal condoms.”
Coming Soon! Get the Latest on the Health is Power Initiative
June 26, 2018
As rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among racial and ethnic minorities continue to rise, local health departments and community-based organizations are continuously exploring effective methods of reaching these populations with sexual health messaging and education. Effective use of social media and social marketing techniques can increase dissemination and reach of health promotion messages targeting sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in underserved populations. One such population is African-American men.
In 2016, African-American men experienced the highest reported rates of primary and secondary syphilis and gonorrhea across all other races/ethnicities and genders, as well as the highest rates of chlamydia among all other racial/ethnic groups. Improving and addressing male SRH needs, particularly in adolescent and young adult populations, are concrete objectives in Healthy People 2020. The benefits of addressing male SRH contribute to improving the lives of individual men and boys, but also extend to their partners, children, families and communities. Yet, compared to female SRH needs, men – particularly heterosexual men – receive minimal attention in literature, clinical health services, and community-based and population health interventions. Additionally, limited guidance exists on effectively reaching African-American men with SRH health promotion messages.
Health is Power (HisP), a social marketing campaign created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of STD Prevention (DSTDP), was specifically designed for heterosexual African-American men, ages 18-30. The campaign seeks to promote positive sexual behaviors through a multi-phased campaign with strength-based messaging around increased condom use, healthy relationships, STD testing and prevention, and open partner communication. The “Health is Power Toolkit” provides various health promotion tools including customizable posters, postcards, social media messages, web banners, and “drop-in” website articles. The availability of these resources allows for further dissemination of the HisP messages along with the option to further evaluate the efficacy of HisP messages within local communities.
In 2016, the National Association of County and City Health Officials and CDC DSTDP partnered with Louisiana Public Health Institute (New Orleans, Louisiana), CCM Foundation (Houston, Texas) and Baltimore City Health Department (Baltimore, Maryland) to conduct demonstration site projects focused on implementing and evaluating local HisP campaigns. Demonstration sites adapted and expanded HisP messages and materials to meet the needs of their local target audience, developed customized implementation plans, and evaluated campaign reach and effectiveness. NACCHO provided technical and capacity-building assistance on effective implementation and evaluation of local HisP efforts. The HisP demonstration sites will finish implementing and evaluating their campaigns by the end of June 2018. Over the next few months, NACCHO will be highlighting the results of this demonstration site project on their website. Stay tuned for detailed information regarding HisP implementation and evaluation results.
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
June 18, 2018
The latest YRBS reports some positive health trends for American youth but points out nagging disparities still persist with sexual minorities.
The 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows fewer young people in the U.S. are having sex and using drugs but cautions that a number of troubling risks remain for youth in at-risk groups.
The report finds that between 2007-2017 the percentage of high school students who say they’ve ever had sex dropped from 47.8% to 39.5%. Condom use during last sexual experience also dipped from 61.5% to 53.8%. The percentage of students using illicit drugs declined from 22.6% in 2007 to 14% in 2017.
Of concern, though, is that Gay, lesbian, bisexual and questioning youth were far more likely to report having experienced violence and bullying. In the press release outlining the findings Jonathan Mermin, M.D., director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention said ““Today’s youth are making better decisions about their health than just a decade ago. But, some experiences, such as physical and sexual violence, are outside their control and continue at painfully high levels. Their experiences today have powerful implications for their lives tomorrow.”

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

October 8, 2018
On October 5, 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26. Gardasil 9 prevents infections with the “high risk” HPV types most commonly found in a number of cancers worldwide, including cervical cancer. The vaccine also protects against “low risk” HPV types associated with most cases of genital warts.
HPV infections are common and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 14 million Americans are diagnosed with HPV each year. While most HPV infections are harmless and clear naturally, the sheer number of cases make it a key public health priority. In the U.S. about 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year and the burden is much higher globally. “High risk” HPV types also are associated with vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, and many head and neck cancers.
To learn more about the HPV vaccine check out the FDA’s press announcement.
For resources and support for HPV and cervical cancer check out NCCC.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term, “female plumbing”? Despite the primitive nickname, it’s actually a good analogy. The female reproductive system is a series of orifices (openings) for intake and output through tubes and passages. The interior part of the system performs the most important functions; the exterior acts as a cover to protect the delicate interior organs. When it’s in good working order, it’s a marvel. When it’s not, it can be disastrous. To continue the image a little further, it pays to understand how the system works so you can maintain, rather than repair it.
Know Your Body
The two halves – interior and exterior – are designed to work together as a whole for one purpose: to enable sperm to fertilize an egg to produce offspring. That’s why sex is so pleasurable; the drive to have sex ensures the continuation of the human race. If the egg is not fertilized within a menstrual cycle, Plan B kicks in. The lining of the uterus isn’t needed to cushion a fetus, so it’s discharged (that’s when you get your period) and the cycle begins again.
There are four reproductive organs within the interior part of the system. Click on any one for more information:
OvariesThe ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus (womb). The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Hormonal methods of birth control manipulate the hormones that cause ovulation and stop it from occurring (in most cases).
VaginaThe vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of uterus) to the outside of the body. Its exterior opening enables sperm to enter the system to reach an egg. If an egg is not fertilized, menstruation results and the blood is carried out of the body through the vagina. It also provides a way for a baby to exit the body. That’s why it’s sometimes referred to as the birth canal.
Fallopian tubesThese are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as tunnels for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Conception, the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, normally occurs in the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants to the uterine wall. If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, this is called an ectopic pregnancy and requires treatment immediately.
UterusThe uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina, and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby.
CervixThe cervix is the lower third of the uterus. The small hole in the center of the cervix, called the os, serves a passageway into the uterus. This is what dilates or stretches during birth. The os also serves as a passageway for menstrual blood. The cervix feels like a half-sphere at the end of the vaginal canal and is where a diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge can be placed to prevent pregnancy. Collection of abnormal cells from the cervix during a pap smear can indicate a possibility of cervical cancer but may also be a simple infection. It is important to have regular pap smears and HPV (an STI that can cause cervical cancer) tests to maintain the health of your cervix and surrounding reproductive organs.
There are five major components that make up the exterior part of the system or the vulva. It is important to remember that every vulva is unique and has different characteristics. Labia (both majora and minora) vary widely in size and length as well as size of the clitoris and clitoral hood. This uniqueness should be treasured and no one characteristic (such as short labia minora) should hold more value than another.
Click on any one for more information:
Mons pubisThe mons is the rounded fatty mass over the pubic bone covered with hair and coarse skin. It acts as a buffer during sexual intercourse, preventing injury to the underlying bone. It also contains sebaceous and sweat glands. Some of the latter form a specialized type of gland called the apocrine glands. These glands release a secretion with a characteristic smell that increases sexual attraction.
Labia majoraLiterally translated as “large lips,” the labia majora are relatively large and fleshy, and are comparable to the scrotum in males. Their job is to enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.
Labia minoraThe labia minora (“small lips”) are delicate flaps of soft skin that lie within the labia majora, creating another layer of protection for the female reproductive organs.
ClitorisThe two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in males. The clitoris is covered by a fold of skin, called the prepuce or clitoral hood, which is similar to the foreskin at the end of the penis. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.
Bartholin's glandsThese two bean-shaped glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce a (mucus) secretion that acts as a lubricating fluid.

Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form. The stock powers should be signed and the signature guaranteed by your local bank or broker. Mail the stock powers, along with a letter indicating your intent to make a gift, to the address below. Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Know Your Body
There’s more to it than what you see. Although most of the male reproductive organs are external, it’s important to understand how all your sex organs—external and internal—work together.
Let’s start with the obvious: There are four major components that make up the exterior part of the male reproductive system. Click on any one for more information:
PenisThe penis is the most visible part of the male sexual anatomy. It is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans (also called the head). The shaft houses the corpora cavernosa (two flexible cylinders comprised of erectile tissue that run the length of the penis and support erections), and the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue surrounding the urethra). When a man reaches sexual climax, he ejaculates a thick fluid (semen) through the urethral opening at the tip of the penis into the vagina. The semen carries sperm cells through the vaginal canal to the uterus where the sperm seek out the female egg for fertilization. Also, when a man urinates, the flow leaves his body through the urethral opening.
UrethraThe urethra is a duct, or tube, that transports fluids from the inside of the body to the outside. In both men and women, the urethra is connected to the bladder and is used to pass urine out of the body. In males, however, the urethra is also connected to the “accessory glands,” which produce semen, and to the vas deferens, the duct that brings the sperm from the epididymis.
TesticlesThe testicles are located below the penis and begin producing male sex cells called sperm and testosterone, the male sex hormone after puberty. A man’s sperm production, once started, continues throughout his life; sexually mature males produce millions of sperm cells each day.
The interior part of the system comprises the following. Click on each for more information:
EpididymisThe epididymis stores the sperm after the testicles produce them.
Vas deferensThe vas deferens is a duct that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
Accessory glandsThere are several glands that work together to produce semen, or seminal fluid. The seminal vesicle produces a fluid that provides energy to the sperm as they seek out the female sex cell, or the egg. The prostate gland makes a different fluid that helps the sperm move more quickly through the female reproductive system. Another set of glands, called bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, makes a small quantity of fluid that helps protect the sperm on its way through the urethra by neutralizing any leftover traces of acidic urine. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for up to 48 hours, and seminal fluid helps the sperm move around and stay nourished.

Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs (sometimes called sexually transmitted infections, or STIs) affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all walks of life. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 million new cases each year, about half of which occur among youth ages 15-24 years.
Getting the facts about STDs/STIs and sexual health is increasingly important. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about specific STDs/STIs, tips for reducing risk, and ways to talk with health care providers and partners.
Diseases that are spread through sexual contact are usually referred to as sexually transmitted diseases or STDs for short. In recent years, however, many experts in this area of public health have suggested replacing STD with a new term—sexually transmitted infection, or STI.
Why the change? The concept of “disease,” as in STD, suggests a clear medical problem, usually some obvious signs or symptoms. But several of the most common STDs have no signs or symptoms in the majority of persons infected. Or they have mild signs and symptoms that can be easily overlooked. So the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria can be described as creating “infection,” which may or may not result in “disease.” This is true of chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), to name a few.
For this reason, for some professionals and organizations the term “disease” is being replaced by “infection.” ASHA has used the term STD since 1988 and it appears in hundreds of published ASHA documents, including this site. Users of this site will continue to see it for some time. But in moving forward, you will also begin to see increased use of the term STI.
But there is not consensus in the medical and public health community, as H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, Professor Emeritus at Washington University Center for AIDS and STD notes in his essay for the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. While making arguments for both terms, Handsfield suggests, “Those who prefer either term should use it freely, with neither defensiveness nor pride in either one.” Read his thoughts and share your comments on STD Prevention Online.
Or is it time for a new term? Medical linguist Janet Byron Anderson, PhD, argues that we do and proposes “sexually transmissible infectious disease (STID).” You can read her take here.

There are many ways you can help support ASHA’s efforts and become involved in sexual and reproductive health advocacy.
Who are ASHA Ambassadors?
Are you passionate about sexual health? Do you have skills to share? Consider getting involved with ASHA. Our volunteer program runs in tandem with our Ambassador program – it allows you to be as involved as you want to be and connects you with our global network of supporters. ASHA ambassadors are sexual health advocates that use social media to share important information. Headquartered on SocialToaster, the ambassador program allows you to share information on a host of sexual health topics straight from your inbox.
If you have a special interest in cervical cancer, you may want to volunteer with a local chapter of our National Cervical Cancer Coalition, or start a chapter of your own.
If you have questions about STDs or want to talk with others, visit ASHA’s online support community or share you story with others here on our site.
Stay up to date on what’s going on at ASHA and in the world of sexual health by subscribing to ASHA’s e-newsletter.

Coming up with a definition of sexual health is a difficult task, as each culture, sub-culture, and individual has different standards of sexual health. ASHA believes that sexual health includes far more than avoiding disease or unplanned pregnancy. We also believe that having a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy does not prevent someone from being or becoming sexually healthy.
Here is ASHA’s definition of sexual health:
Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STDs and seek care and treatment when needed.
Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.
Defining Sexual Health
ASHA Board member and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, considers the term sexual health, how it is used, and how it can be defined.
The phrase “sexual health” encompasses a range of public health and clinical issues related to prevention of sexually transmitted infections. I use the phrase a lot in my own work and its widening currency is a welcome new paradigm in our field. In fact, the concept of sexual health seems to me of fundamental relevance to all aspects of prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
To be honest, though, all of the talk about sexual health doesn’t seem to have influenced the day-to-day particulars of our work. Sex still is primarily seen as a set of risk factors that we counsel against. I am convinced that this perspective on sex and sexuality as “risk” legitimates the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections and contributes to our society’s poisonous intolerance of sexual diversity. A sexual health perspective incorporates the concept of personal and epidemiologic risks of sex, but recognizes the pervasive importance of sex in our lives.
However, I’ve begun to wonder if I know what sexual health means in the first place. It’s a big concept, and maybe it’s natural that definitions seem idealistic, overwrought, and self-righteous. Consider the well-known working definition of the World Health Organization:
“Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
There is a lot to agree with in this definition, especially in its recognition of the complex physical, emotional, mental and social attributes of sexual health, and the anchoring of sexual health in universal sexual rights. But, I find this definition to be quaintly admonishing and parental (“…the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences…”). More importantly, however, the definition is sexually vague. No matter how many times I’ve read, used, and cited this definition, I can’t derive from it even a rudimentary vision of how sexual health operates in people’s daily lives. I feel the same about the more recently wrought definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, particularly because sexual rights and of sexual pleasure are absent from that sexual health definition.
So, maybe I need to get clearer with myself about what sexual health is. And, sexual health should be more than just the negatives: not coerced; not discriminated; not violent. The prevalence of these negatives in many people’s lives tells us how far we are from achieving a just and equitable society. But I think that sexual health ultimately requires much more active involvement from all of us, and it seems quite insufficient to hope that sexual health will arise on its own if coercion, discrimination, and violence are finally conquered.

Ways to Give
Donate Online
Thank you for joining us in our efforts to educate and raise awareness of sexual health and sexually transmitted infections. Your contribution allows us to continue to provide vital services. Click below and choose the ASHA or NCCC program you would like to support.  Join our Sustainers Circle by signing up to make a monthly gift and you’ll receive a free USB drive filled with historical ASHA posters. Questions? Please call us at 800-552-4375.
Memorial and Tribute Donations
Make a gift in honor or in memory of someone special. This is a unique and wonderful way to acknowledge them. A letter will be sent to his or her family to inform them of your generous gift, though the amount of your contribution will remain confidential.
Endowment Fund
A gift toward ASHA’s endowment helps ensure that the American Sexual Health Association can provide services to the current as well as future generations. Donors can establish a named endowment with an investment of $10,000. This is a wonderful way to create your own legacy or to honor your family or a family member and ensure the continued excellence of ASHA’s programs and services.
Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form. The stock powers should be signed and the signature guaranteed by your local bank or broker. Mail the stock powers, along with a letter indicating your intent to make a gift, to the address below. Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—The federal public health agency serving as the center for preventing, tracking, controlling and investigating the epidemiology of AIDS and other diseases.
Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

The New World of Cervical Cancer Screening
September 28, 2016
It used to be very simple – a woman had an annual Pap test. Now, Paps can be done alone or in combination with an HPV test (one HPV test can even be used for primary cervical cancer screening). Added to the mix is a set of updated guidelines that, for most women, means an annual cervical cancer screening exam is a thing of the past.
It can all be very confusing, even for healthcare providers! Not to worry: in this episode, we talk to Ina Park, MD, who sorts it all out for us. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, in the Department of Family and Community Medicine. Dr. Park is also the medical director of the California Prevention Training Center.

Coping with Cervical Cancer
September 29, 2015
Cancer can be isolating, and it’s easy to see where friends and family members who haven’t personally dealt with cancer—and if they have, probably haven’t dealt with your specific cancer—aren’t able to fully relate and a patient can feel alone in some ways. The volunteer chapter leaders who work with ASHA’s National Cervical Cancer Coalition (NCCC) understand this well; many chapter leaders are cervical cancer survivors or patients, others are family members who lost a loved one to the disease.
In honor of Gynecologic Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, ASHA’s Fred Wyand asked NCCC chapter leaders to share their insights around what NCCC offers, coping with treatment and follow-up, and anything else they think women and families should know when it comes to dealing with cervical cancer. Fred shares their responses in this episode and underscores the need for support and the value in finding others who really understand and appreciate what a patient is going through.

Sexual health is not just about sex—it includes the roles, behaviors, and values people associate with being a man or a woman. Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.
Be an Askable Parent
Does your child feel it’s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child’s questions? Only you can tell your child that it’s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child’s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child’s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.
Here are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?
An askable parent:
Shows respect, value, and love for children.
Realizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.
Wants communication, but doesn’t expect to have all the answers.
Knows the most important part of communication is listening.
Doesn’t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child’s cuteness.
Doesn’t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.
Is sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.
Children are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.
Continue to Learn
While talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn’t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so–you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk.”
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.
Be prepared
Parents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child’s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, “Do you mean…?” or “do you want to know about…?” After you’ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate–you don’t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.

New CDC Data Show that STD Rates Continue to Rise
August 29, 2018
New data released today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal that STD rates continue to climb in the U.S., with nearly 2.3 million cases reported to CDC. The data on five year trends in reported STDs show that increases in STDs have continued for four consecutive years. From 2013-2017:
Syphilis cases nearly doubled
Gonorrhea cases increased by 67%
Chlamydia remained at record highs
As Gail Bolan, MD, Director of the Division of STD Prevention at CDC commented, “After decades of declining STDs, in recent years, we’ve been sliding backwards. In addition to these sharp increases, we’re also facing new challenges that we must address like the potential link between STD risk and drug use and the ongoing threat that gonorrhea will eventually wear down our last highly effective antibiotic.”
While striking, the data on reported STDs is only part of the story. Many cases go undiagnosed and untreated, and the consequences of untreated infections can be severe. While chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are curable with antibiotics, complications of untreated infection include infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth in infants, and increased HIV risk.
Also important to note is the fact that STDs impact some groups more than others. Men who have sex with men (MSM) made up almost 70 percent of primary and secondary syphilis, and young women 15-24 made up about 45 percent of the 1.7 million reported cases of chlamydia.
In a press briefing announcing the release of the new data, Bolan noted the importance of following CDC’s recommendations for screening. As she stated, “We recommend that all sexually active women less than the age of 25 go in and get checked for chlamydia and gonorrhea on an annual basis. We recommend that men who are having sex with men, go in and get checked at least annually for sexually transmitted diseases…We just need to get our providers doing sexual histories and doing the appropriate screening and we need to have clients who come in and access care to be asking, do I need to be – everyone needs to ask their doctor, should I be tested for STDs, I hear they’re going up. So, have that conversation.”

HSV Rates Dropping
February 13, 2018
Rates of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) dipped between 1999 and 2016 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Among those in the U.S. ages 14-49 the prevalence of HSV-2 in 2016 (all of those with HSV-2 in the age range being studied) was 12%, down from 18% in 1999. Approximately 1 in 8 individuals in this age group have HSV-2, which is almost always experienced as a genital infection. Most individuals with genital herpes are undiagnosed and not aware they have the virus.
HSV-1 prevalence also dropped during the same period, from 59% in 1999 to 48%. HSV-1 is typically experienced as an oral infection (cold sores) but research suggests HSV-1 is found with nearly half of all new genital herpes infections.
The data were collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and reported in Prevalence of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and Type 2 in Persons Ages 14-49: United States, 2015-2016 (McQuillan et al). NHANES is a series of continuing studies assessing the health of adults and children in the U.S.

STD Rates in the U.S. Rise for the Third Straight Year
September 28, 2017
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says 2016 was the third straight year of increasing rates for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.
The 2016 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report released earlier this week, points to the same worrisome trends noted in recent years: nearly 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the U.S. each year with the most vulnerable populations—particularly young people, women, and men who have sex with men—continuing to endure a significant share of the burden.
ASHA board member and sexual health expert J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, MS, says “It’s important to remember that STDs are an especially obvious health inequity for young people, for marginalized people. This means that STDs are consequences of far more than individual behaviors, and are products of our society’s continued inattention to community, to racism, sexual and gender discrimination, and tolerance of violence.”
The 27,814 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2016 represents an 18.5% increase over the previous year, with 90% of cases reported in men. Gonorrhea cases in 2016 increased 18.5% to 468,514 and chlamydia incidence rose 4.7% to approximately 1.6 million cases. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. Earlier this year ASHA launched the Yes Means Test initiative to increase awareness of STDs and encourage testing. Visitors to Yes Means Test website can utilize a clinic locator to search free/low cost testing services in their area.
Asked for factors driving the epidemic Dr. Fortenberry says a lack of investment in prevention services is key: “Effective public health approaches to STD control require a substantial infrastructure for public health education, surveillance, case identification, and treatment. We have fallen below a threshold of minimal investment and are seeing the predictable consequences.”
Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion Rates in US Adolescents Hit Historic Lows
September 12, 2017
A new report from the Guttmacher Institute reveals that rates of adolescent pregnancy, birth and abortion in the United States reached historic lows in 2013.
The decline among teens specifically is striking: the U.S. pregnancy rate among 15–19-year-olds was at its lowest point in at least 80 years and had dropped to just above one-third of a recent peak rate in 1990.
As the lead author of the report Kathryn Kost noted in a news release, “These new estimates affirm that long-term declines in adolescent pregnancies, births and abortions have continued. The available evidence suggests that improved contraceptive use continues to be the primary driver of these declines.” Indeed, the report discusses recent research showing significant increases in the use of contraceptives in young women, including
the use of multiple methods and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods.
Read the full report at Guttmacher.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Educating a child about sex is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime. You, as a loving parent (or caregiver), are uniquely qualified to be your child’s first and best teacher.
Educating your child about sex involves much more than explaining how the physical side of sex works. You’ll want your child to understand that emotions, intimacy, moral values, personal responsibility, sexual orientation, gender differences and self-image all play a role in establishing our sexual selves.
Some parents ask…
“Can’t the school take care of it? I don’t want either of us to be embarrassed.”
You may be uncomfortable talking about sex with your child. If so, say so. He’ll appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be a running dialogue between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through “the talk about the birds and the bees.”Consider what might happen if you leave this responsibility to others:
The school sex-ed program may provide accurate information, but won’t include your personal moral values and insights.
If your child relies on friends for information, it’s likely the information will not be accurate and the advice misguided because your child’s friends lack the maturity and experience of a caring adult.
Movies, television, the Internet, music and books with sexual content may confuse, mislead or upset your child if you’re not there to offer your interpretation.
If your family practices a religion, an explanation from an outside source is unlikely to weave your religious convictions into the discussion.
And the most important reason of all:
Research shows that teens are less likely to have sex at an early age if they feel close to their parents and if their parents clearly communicate their values.
So how do you start the conversation? What’s the best age to start talking? What if I don’t know all the answers? Keep reading to learn how to start the conversation with your kids . . . and what to do if you don’t know all the answers (hint: it’s okay!).

Cervical Cancer Screening
September 28, 2015
Cervical cancer screening used to all be so simple—women were told just go for your annual Pap. But now we have new tests to screen for cervical cancer, plus updated guidelines that, for most women, mean routine screening is done every few years rather than annually.
The changes are confusing not only to women but their healthcare providers, too. So to sort all this out, we’re talking today with Dr. Warner Huh, Division Director and Professor in the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
HPV FAQs
September 9, 2015
Most sexually active individuals are estimated to have one or more infections in their lifetime with the human papillomavirus (HPV) and, not surprisingly, ASHA receives countless HPV questions like:
What should I tell a partner?
Will I always have it?
How are HPV tests used?
How well do vaccines work?
In this episode, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, covers these and other common questions about HPV. Dr. Handsfield is Professor Emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, and former director of the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Program for Public Health—Seattle & King County, Seattle, Washington. He recently completed six years as a member of ASHA’s Board of Directors.
Breathing New Life into Your Sexual Relationship
July 16, 2015
Fred Wyand talks to Walker Thornton, M.Ed, about reigniting the spark your sex life and communicating about sexual pleasure. Thornton writes extensively about sexuality, relationships, sexual health, and caregiving, with a special focus on sexual health and aging.
All about HPV with Ina Park, MD
July 6, 2015
Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is a common sexually transmitted infection. So common that most (~80%) of sexually active people will be infected with HPV at some point. While it is often harmless, it can cause genital warts and even lead to cervical cancer. In this episode, Fred Wyand talks to Ina Park, MD, assistant professor at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine, about HPV, from genital warts, cervical cancer vaccines, the stigma associated with warts “below the waistline,” talking to partners about HPV, and more.
Understanding STI Testing
July 6, 2015
We have an abundance of accurate, relatively inexpensive tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) but the trick is engaging patients and health professionals so the proper tests are given to the right individuals.
In this episode of ASHA’s Sex+Health podcast we chat with J. Dennis Fortenberry, MD, MS, professor of pediatrics and medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine, about barriers to STI testing and what we can do to empower patients and providers alike.
Dual Use of Condoms and LARC
July 6, 2015
Long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, is reversible birth control that provides long-lasting (think years) pregnancy prevention. LARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable, but they don’t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.
ASHA’s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses dual use of LARC and condoms in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast. Fred explains the facts about LARC and the added benefit of dual use of LARC and condoms to prevent STIs.

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

STIs
One in two sexually active persons will contract an STI by age 25.1
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year in this country, half of those among young people aged 15–24. 2
Even though young people account for half of new STI cases, a recent survey showed only about 12% were tested for STIs in the last year.3
CDC estimates that undiagnosed STIs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.4
The total estimated direct cost of STIs annually in the U.S. about $16 billion.5
HPV
Researchers estimate that at least 80% of sexually active people will have an HPV infection at some point in their lifetime.6
CDC data for 2013–2014 show that about 42% of men and 40% of women aged 18-59 had genital HPV at that time.7
HPV is responsible for approximately 31,500 cases of cancer each year, including nearly all cases of cervical and anal cancer, about 75% of vaginal cancer, 70% of oropharyngeal cancer, and 69% of vulvar cancer.8
Within 6 years of the introduction of the first HPV vaccine, there was a 64% decrease in HPV prevalence among females aged 14 to 19 years and a 34% decrease among those aged 20 to 24 years.9
Herpes
Herpes infection is common. About 1 in 8 people aged 14-49 in the U.S. has genital herpes.10
About 1 in 2 people ages 14-49 in the U.S. are infected with HSV-1, which is the typical cause of oral herpes. However, increasing numbers of genital herpes cases are caused by HSV-1.11
Symptoms of genital herpes often go unnoticed. Most people with genital herpes—close to 90%—don’t know they have the infection. 12
Globally, researchers estimate that about two-thirds of the population under age 50—more than 3.7 billion people–are infected with HSV-1. Some 140 million people aged 15-49 are infected with genital HSV-1, primarily in the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific.13
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis
In 2015, rates of the three most common reportable STIs—chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis—reached a record high level. The approximately 1.5 million reported cases of chlamydia represent the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to CDC.2
While CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend annual chlamydia screening for sexually active young women ages 15-24, fewer than half of eligible women are screened according the guidelines.14
Young people ages 15 to 24 years old accounted for 65% of chlamydia diagnoses and 50% of gonorrhea diagnoses in 2015.2
During 2014–2015, rates of syphilis in both men and women increased in every region of the country.15
From 2013–2015, the reported gonorrhea infections increased each year. In 2015, a total of 395,216 cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 gonorrhea cases per 100,000 population.15
In women, undiagnosed and untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. (PID). According to CDC, 1 in 8 women with a history of PID experience difficulties getting pregnant.16
Hepatitis
CDC estimates that approximately 850,000 persons are living with hepatitis B in the U.S., although other studies have estimated this number to be as high as 2.2 million.17
The rate of new hepatitis B infections has declined by approximately 82% since 1991, when routine vaccination of children was first recommended.18
Of the more than 3 million people living with Hepatitis C, 3 out of every 4 are “Baby Boomers,” born from 1945-1965. Baby boomers are five times more likely to have Hepatitis C than other adults.19
HIV
According to CDC, 1.1 million people in the US are living with HIV, and 1 in 7 of them don’t know it.20
In 2015, 39,513 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the U.S. in 2015.20
In 2013, an estimated 42% of Americans living with diagnosed HIV were aged 50 and older, 25% were aged 55 and older, and 6% were aged 65 and older.21
Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, involves talking a daily medication to prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative. When taken consistently, PrEP has shown to reduce HIV infection risk by up to 92%.22

More than “Revenge”: Nonconsensual Porn
July 7, 2017
The term “revenge porn” made headlines in celebrity news this week, after Rob Kardashian posted explicit photos of ex-girlfriend Blac Chyna on his Instagram account, which was subsequently suspended. In California, where Kardashian lives, it is a crime for a person to distribute intimate, sexually explicit images “when he/she knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause serious emotional distress, and the person depicted suffers that distress,” and legal experts weighed in on HuffPo on the possible consequences of his actions. Whatever the motives in this case, the term “revenge porn” can be misleading, as individuals may post or share sexuality explicit photos for different reasons. The broader term “nonconsensual porn” better expresses what’s at issue here—explicit images are shared without an individual’s consent.
The problem is not uncommon. A 2016 report from the Data & Society Research Institute found that about 10.4 million people in the U.S. “have been threatened with or experienced the posting of explicit images without their consent.” Both men and women can be victims of nonconsensual porn, but the majority of nonconsensual images are of women—including service women. Earlier this year it was revealed that nude photos of more than two dozen female service members, active duty and veterans, were being shared by marines in a private Facebook group. While the marines involved may face charges under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, civilians can face legal consequences for sharing images without consent. According to the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, 38 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws against nonconsensual porn. The organization offers more information about nonconsensual porn and state laws here.
A New Gender Option in Oregon
July 7, 2017
As of July 1, Oregon residents will have three options for gender on state-issued IDs and driver’s licenses: M, F or X. The X offers an option for individuals who identify as non-binary, neither exclusively male or female. The decision by the state’s Transportation Commission makes Oregon the first state in the country to allow residents to identify as non-binary. The Oregonian reports that plans for the new option were first announced last summer and 83 public comments were submitted to the
Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles. Only 12 people opposed the change.
While Oregon may be the first state to recognize non-binary identity, California is not far behind. The Gender Recognition Act, or Senate Bill 179, would allow an individual to change their gender on a birth certificate or driver’s license to be female, male, or non-binary. The bill has been passed in the senate and now must make it through the General Assembly and the office of the governor.
Support for Same-Sex Marriage on the Rise
July 6, 2017
In a 2001 poll by the Pew Research Center—a nonpartisan organization that conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, and other empirical social science research—Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a margin of 57% to 35%. Polling in 2017 shows a significant change in those numbers, with 62% expressing support for same-sex marriage versus 32% opposed. This most recent poll also marked the first time that a majority of those in specific demographic groups, including Baby Boomers, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, did not oppose same-sex marriage.
Check out the Pew Research Center site for an interactive look at the changing views on same-sex marriage.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

ASHA’s work is focused around three important objectives:
Educate: Be the source of scientifically-based and accessible information
Build Alliances: Collaborate with other organizations to expand the understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model
Advocate: Advance supportive changes in sexual health policy
Educate
Thousands of individuals turn to ASHA each year looking for information and guidance from a reliable source. Our many websites and publications serve as a critical means of information and support to users around the world who have difficulty accessing clear, non-biased information on sexual and reproductive health. From individuals with questions on sexually transmitted infections, to parents looking for advice on how to talk to their kids about sexual health, to patients looking for support, ASHA is a trusted resource. And with our grassroots program the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, we also offer that education and support in local communities as well.
Our education efforts extend to specific audiences beyond the general public, including healthcare providers. From the creation of continuing education programs for physicians to the development of resources such as toolkits, videos and apps geared toward providers, ASHA works to ensure that providers can offer the best sexual health care to their patients.
With their ability to reach wide audience, the media are also an important target of ASHA’s outreach. We work with a wide range of media outlets—TV, radio, print media, and popular web outlets—as a sought-after commentator on news and trends in popular culture that touch on sexual health issues, promoting positive coverage that destigmatizes the subject.
Build Alliances
We work with a number of national organizations and that share our goals of promoting sexual health issues in order to strengthen advocacy for sexual health promotion. ASHA is a key member of such entities as the National Sexual Health Coalition, the North American Federation of Sexual Health Organizations, and Cervical Cancer Free America. We also regularly bring together and consult with professionals in the field to promote better understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model.
Advocate
ASHA maintains a policy office in Washington, DC, affirming its long-term commitment to advocacy for systemic change. ASHA’s Washington office works to secure sound policy responses to the sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic in the areas of prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and education through efforts with policymakers and national organizations. ASHA has been successful in obtaining bipartisan support for STI programs and continues to educate policy makers about the economic, social, and public health benefits of appropriate STI policy.
We work in coalition with organizations in family planning, HIV, and women’s health, as well as organizations representing people of color and faith-based groups to keep STIs on the forefront of the policy agenda. ASHA is routinely asked to provide strategy and content advice on sexual health-related issues to a variety of national organizations and also provides leadership on numerous boards and committees.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Sexual Pleasure
Sexuality is a fundamental component of what it means to be human. It is one of the most basic drives behind the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of human beings. So if we’re built to attract a mate, have we refined our sexual practices beyond mindless coupling?  When having sex with a partner, we aim to understand our partner’s desires and enjoy fulfilling them. When masturbating, we aim to understand and love our own bodies. Sexual pleasure is about exploring and embracing our human sexuality to fulfill our desires. It is completely natural.
We’re All Different
Whether we’re attracted to the opposite sex, the same sex or both, the truth is: We learn how to experience sexual pleasure for pleasure’s sake by understanding our own sexual desires and responses.
Our enjoyment of specific sexual behaviors and practices varies from one individual to another. For example, pornography may be irresistible to some people and repugnant to others. The point is that no matter what stimulates our individual sexual desires or which sexual practices we use to satisfy them, we are all sexual beings. How we choose to behave as sexual beings is up to us.
Health Benefits
Remember, sex has been shown to promote better sleep habits, less stress, more happiness, etc. Sex is a healthy bodily function. Our bodies thrive on the chemicals released during orgasm, so a healthy sex life is indeed part of a healthy body.
How will you experience sexual pleasure?
Are you or were you ever under the impression that there’s a “right” way to enjoy sex? A lot of what we see and hear – movies and TV shows, commercials, even listening to the exploits of our friends – would have you think so. If you’re wondering why your sex life isn’t playing out the way modern culture tells you it should, it’s good to remind yourself that your sexual-response triggers are unique to you. So how will you experience sexual pleasure?
Maybe you have a sexual fantasy. If you have a partner, he/she might enjoy it as much as you do! Talk about it with your partner. Understand that sexual pleasure is a matter of mutual interest. Remember that consenting adults can be as sexually adventurous as they please. And don’t forget that your partner is likely to have an entirely different set of turn-ons.
Communication is Key
Successful, long-term relationships are based on communication. Feeling safe and trusting our partner is the foundation for comfortable, relaxed healthy sex. Safety, comfort and trust allow us to freely discuss our sexual needs and limitations with a partner. Be direct! Speak up!
“I like it when you touch…”
“I really enjoy…”
Everyone doesn’t have a partner. Not everyone wants a partner. Some people are between partners. The reality is: You don’t need a partner to enjoy great sex.
“Would you like me to…”
Open, frank communication with a partner is fundamental to giving and receiving maximum sexual pleasure. Mutual trust in each other’s desire to please while respecting personal boundaries can lead to heightened enjoyment
.
It’s About You
It’s okay–even healthy–to masturbate regularly. Orgasm not only relieves stress; it also boosts the immune system and burns calories! Indulge in whichever solitary sexual behaviors bring the most pleasure. It’s up to you to choose how you reach orgasm. There are no rules, no “right ways” to achieve sexual pleasure as long as there’s no danger to you or anyone else.
A satisfying sex life begins and ends with an acknowledgement and understanding of our ownsexual needs and responsibilities. Ultimately, we are responsible for our own sexual pleasure. Then we can acknowledge the needs and responsibilities of our partners.

What’s the best age to start teaching my child about sex?
You’ve already started! Young children learn by observing their parents. They watch how you dress and how you carry yourself. They see how you interact with the opposite sex; and they notice how you react to intimacy and affection. Now all you have to do is build on their observations.
How can I open the topic for discussion?
The first step is to understand how much your child already knows about sex, and the easiest way to do that is to be a good listener. Pay attention to what your child says to friends and siblings. From there, look for opportunities in everyday life to start a conversation. Remember, while we sometimes hear about having “the talk” with children about sex and sexual health, it is really a series of conversations that happen over time. Talking about sexual health is an ongoing discussion, and you can take many opportunities to continue the conversation.
Here are just a few:
Go for a walk with your child… away from the house, the phone, the television and other family members.
Turn off the radio in the car. Take advantage of the privacy to just talk.
Find out if and when the topic will be addressed at school. Time your discussions to coincide with the information offered in the classroom.
Television shows, books, movies, fashion, etc., provide plenty of situations you and your child can discuss. You might ask your child how he feels or what he thinks about what he just saw or read.
How much should I tell my child?
Simply put, as much as he wants to know. A preschooler might want to know where babies come from and would be satisfied with a response such as, “a warm, safe place in Mommy’s belly.” An older child’s questions would be more complex and require more detailed answers. A teenager needs answers to numerous sexual topics. Consider discussing:
Anatomy and reproduction in both males and females
The physical and emotional differences between men and women
Sexual intercourse and other forms of sexual behavior (oral sex, masturbation and petting)
Fertility, pregnancy and birth control
Sexually transmitted diseases and infections (STDs/STIs)
Sexual orientation and gender identity
Self-respect, self-image and peer pressure
Responsible behavior based on informed decisions
Risky behaviors that can lead to pregnancy, rape or abuse
What if I don’t know all the answers?
Then you’re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to experts for the information you need. Other parents, teachers, members of the clergy, health care providers and the Internet are excellent sources of information and support. In fact, we offer information and advice to parents on our teen website.
It’s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safe sex is vital when he decides to become sexually active.
When you talk to your child about sex, use the same open, honest communication skills you’d use when talking about any delicate topic.
Be open, honest and available.
Use words that are understandable and comfortable. Leave the technical jargon to the experts.
Encourage your child to talk and ask questions. Listen to the answers.
If your child asks a question, answer immediately, even if the timing isn’t perfect. You can always expand on the topic at a more opportune time.
Try to determine what your child is really asking. Is he/she worried about being “normal”? Is there a moral, religious or cultural conflict? Does your child want to check his knowledge against yours? Listening – really listening – is the key to good communication.
Maintain a calm, non-judgmental attitude. A sense of humor can relieve tension and facilitate discussion. It’s okay to talk about your own discomfort and make light of it.
Don’t laugh. No matter what, don’t laugh.
If you don’t have a ready answer, admit it. Offer to find the answer with your child or on your own.
Above all, remind your child that you love and respect him and will always be there for him.
What if my child is gay?
Your child may indeed be gay or conflicted about sexual orientation or gender identity. You can help resolve conflict by:
Loving and accepting your child exactly as he or she is
Acknowledging that as difficult as it might be for you to hear this news, it was much more difficult for your child to tell you.
Remembering that some gay teens are at risk for anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and other problems.
Seeking guidance from outside counselors, health care providers and websites like this one.

Our bodies are designed with the built-in capability to attract a sexual partner. What sets human sexuality apart from animal and plant sexuality is our capacity–or even drive–to discover how to give and receive pleasure through sexual activity.
So if we’re built to attract a mate, have we refined our sexual practices beyond mindless coupling? We call it “making love” for a reason: we understand our partner’s desires and love fulfilling them. And if we enjoy sexual activities without a partner, we understand and love ourselves enough to give and receive sexual satisfaction to ourselves. Yes, it’s quite acceptable, healthy, in fact, to masturbate.
We’re All Different
Whether we’re attracted to the opposite sex, the same sex or both, the truth is: We learn how to experience sexual pleasure for pleasure’s sake by understanding our own sexual desires and responses.
Our enjoyment of specific sexual behaviors and practices varies from one individual to another. For example, pornography may be irresistible to some people and repugnant to others. The point is that no matter what stimulates our individual sexual desires or which sexual practices we use to satisfy them, we are all sexual beings. How we choose to behave as sexual beings is up to us.
Health Benefits
Remember, sex has been shown to promote better sleep habits, less stress, more happiness, etc. Sex is a healthy bodily function. Our bodies thrive on the chemicals released during orgasm, so a healthy sex life is indeed part of a healthy body.
How will you experience sexual pleasure?
Are you or were you ever under the impression that there’s a “right” way to enjoy sex? Sex quizzes in women’s magazines, romance novels, (and maybe your grandmother) would have you think so. If you’re wondering why your sex life isn’t playing out like a steamy love story, it’s good to remind yourself that your sexual-response triggers are unique to you, so how will you experience sexual pleasure?
Start with that rich fantasy life you’ve written in your head. If you have a partner, he/she might enjoy it as much as you do! Talk about it with your partner. Understand that sexual pleasure is a matter of mutual interest. Remember that consenting adults can be as sexually adventurous as they please. And don’t forget that your partner is likely to have an entirely different set of turn-ons and favorite pleasure spots.
Communication is Key
Successful, long-term relationships are based on communication. Feeling safe and trusting our partner is the foundation for comfortable, relaxed healthy sex. Safety, comfort and trust allow us to freely discuss our sexual needs and limitations with a partner. Be direct! Speak up!
“I like it when you touch…”
“I really enjoy…”
“Would you like me to…”
Open, frank communication with a partner is fundamental to giving and receiving maximum sexual pleasure. Mutual trust in each other’s desire to please while respecting personal boundaries can lead to heightened enjoyment.
It’s About You
Everyone doesn’t have a partner. Not everyone wants a partner. Some people are between partners. The reality is: You don’t need a partner to enjoy great sex.
It’s okay–even healthy–to masturbate regularly. Orgasm not only relieves stress; it also boosts the immune system and burns calories! Indulge in whichever solitary sexual behaviors bring the most pleasure. It’s up to you to choose how you reach orgasm (videos, sex toys, or just hot fantasies and a bottle of lube). There are no rules, no “right ways” to achieve sexual pleasure as long as there’s no danger to you or anyone else.
A satisfying sex life begins and ends with an acknowledgment and understanding of our own sexual needs and responsibilities. Ultimately, we are responsible for our own sexual pleasure. Then we can acknowledge the needs and responsibilities of our partners.

It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
If you have any symptoms that you’re just not sure about, get evaluated. But you don’t have to have a symptom to get checked, though. All sexually active women under age 26 are recommended to be tested yearly for chlamydia. Older women with risk factors (new or several partners) should also be tested. If you have questions about testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), don’t be shy about talking to your healthcare provider (learn more how to do that here).
Also, ask about pelvic exams (see more below) and Pap tests. While not designed to detect STIs, these simple exams are an important part of a woman’s sexual and reproductive health.
Learn to Recognize Problems
Vaginal Health
The vagina is designed to keep itself clean with natural, healthy vaginal secretions. A healthy vagina does makes a discharge—slippery and clear or whitish when moist, may turn yellowish when dried, and has little odor. This healthy discharge may also be thicker during some parts of the month. Unhealthy discharge is different. It often has an odd color (yellow, greenish, gray or thick white) and may also have strong, unpleasant odor.
An unusual discharge is only one sign of possible problems, though. Swelling, itching or burning in and around the vagina can also signal a problem. These symptoms are referred to as vaginitis, a broad term to describe different types of vaginal infections. Vaginitis is very common, with common causes including yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.
Get checked if:
You’re having unusual or heavy vaginal discharge.
Your discharge has strong odor, particularly if it is “fish-like”
You experience itching or irritation in and around the vagina.
Menstrual Issues
Irregular Cycles
In a perfect world, women would have their period on a regular cycle of 28 days. In reality, the range is more like 21-45 days. A young girl who is just beginning to have her periods and an older woman who’s at the end of her reproductive life may both have erratic periods.
Get checked if:
You’re sexually active and skip a period. You may be pregnant.
Your period still hasn’t settled into a relatively predictable pattern after three years, or if you have four or five regular periods and then skip a period or becomes irregular.
Your cycle is less than 21 days or more than 45 days or if you don’t get a period for three months after first beginning your period.
Heavy, prolonged periods or no periods at all
Either extreme can be a sign of trouble. The cause may be as simple as a hormone imbalance or as serious as a structural problem.
It can be helpful to use an app to track your periods so that you can see evidence of irregularities when they pop up. There are lots of period trackers out there including: Spot On by Planned Parenthood, Clue, Flo, and many more. Many allow you to track other symptoms or even remind you to take birth control.
Get checked if:
You’re soaking through at least one sanitary napkin (pad) an hour for several hours in a row
You have periods that last longer than 7 days
You haven’t started your period and you’re three years past the first signs of puberty or 16 years old
You’ve had normal periods then suddenly stop having periods for more than six months or for three of your usual cycles
Painful periods
Having cramps for a day or two of your period is normal, but if they’re severe enough to keep you from participating in your normal activities, it’s time to get checked.
Abnormal bleeding
This could be a sign of many things, such as endometriosis (tissue growing outside the uterus) for example, or other conditions. Get checked.
Toxic shock syndrome
This illness is caused by toxins, which create a bacterial infection. While linked with tampon use, it can also associated with the use of contraceptive sponge and diaphragm. If you have a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting or are in shock, get checked right away. Of course, the symptoms may not be related to toxic shock syndrome, but better to be safe than sorry.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant. Remember, many STIs do not produce symptoms.
However, if you notice any of the following:
pain in the pelvic area
pain in the lower abdomen
pain when having sex
discharge from the vagina
a bad smell
bleeding between periods
burning when you pee
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
painful bowel movements
nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite
fever or fatigue
blisters, sores, warts (or any odd skin change, including rashes and yellowed skin)
itching or swelling
inflammation (redness)
…get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms (or lack of) are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, bleeding between periods is simply the result of a normal, age-related hormone imbalance or a sexually transmitted infection. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get an STD/STI. By age 25, half of all young people will have acquired one or more infections. If you have any symptoms that you’re just not sure about, get evaluated.
What to Expect at Your First Pelvic Exam
Whoever you choose—male or female doctor, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant—let the provider know this is your first exam. He or she will be more apt to explain the procedure as you go along. Your provider will examine your external sexual organs for any changes or abnormalities. They will also use an instrument called a speculum to open your vagina and take a look at your cervix. A Pap test is often done as part of a pelvic exam. While the vagina is open, the healthcare provider will use a small stick or brush to take a collection of cells from your cervix. These cells are then sent to a lab and examined under a microscope for anything that looks abnormal. The Pap test is an important means of preventing cervical cancer.
Your provider may also perform a bimanual and/or rectovaginal exam. During the bimanual exam, the doctor will put one or two gloved and lubricated fingers into the vaginal while feeling the abdomen so that they can feel the placement of internal reproductive organs and check for signs of cysts, tumors, or pain. During a rectovaginal exam, the provider would place a gloved and lubricated finger into the rectum to check for issues behind the uterus. Sometimes, they place a finger in the rectum and another in the vagina to check the pelvic floor muscles for issues.
The whole exam is quick, painless and necessary.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked.

ASHA works with members of Congress and other important partners in health policy to educate policy makers about the urgency of sexual health, the need for additional research, and the importance of frontline support for sexual health programs in our communities. You can help ASHA make the case for sound sexual health policy by contacting your elected officials. Legislators listen to their constituents. Legislators are very interested in effectively articulated concerns expressed by the voters they represent.
The most effective communication remains the personal message, whether by mail, visit, or phone, from a concerned constituent. Click here for points you can make with your elected officials.
You can identify your senators and representatives along with contact information on the Senate and House websites.
Letters
A poll of House and Senate staff members asked what form of communication makes the most impression on them and the legislators for whom they work. The overwhelming response was articulate, thoughtful and timely letters from constituents. Letters should be kept short and to the point. The most effective letters tie the relevant issue to the legislator’s home state or district. If you know how STD funding levels will have a local impact, be sure to include this information in your communication.
Address for letters to Senators:
The Honorable (Name)
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator (last name):
Address for letters to Representatives:
The Honorable (Name)
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Representative (last name):
For correspondence to a Senate committee or to a Senate committee chair:
(Name of Committee)
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510
or
The Honorable (Name)
Chairman, Committee on (Name)
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510
Visits
Meeting with a member of Congress or congressional staff is a very effective way to convey a message about a specific legislative issue. Legislators are real people, elected by you to represent your interests. Most are extremely personable and will genuinely enjoy meeting you. Appointments can be arranged by calling or writing the legislator’s district or Washington office. Always identify yourself as a constituent when asking for an appointment. If the legislator is unavailable, the appropriate staff person may offer to meet with you—don’t pass up this opportunity to initiate a relationship.
Tips When Meeting with a Member of Congress
Be Prompt and Patient: When it is time to meet, be punctual and be patient. It is not uncommon for a congressperson to be late, or to have a meeting interrupted, due to the member’s crowded schedule. If interruptions do occur, be flexible. When the opportunity presents itself, continue your meeting with a member’s staff.
Be Prepared: Have your facts lined up prior to the meeting. Whenever possible, bring to the meeting information and materials supporting your position. Always have concisely written documents or clear graphics that reinforce your position and oral presentation.
Assume No Knowledge: Members and staff usually know little or nothing about our issues. Be sure to explain all acronyms, programs, funding sources and which agencies administer the funds.
Localize the Issue: Members of Congress want to represent the best interests of their district or state. Wherever possible, demonstrate the connection between what you are requesting and the interests of the member’s constituency.
Be Responsive: Be prepared to answer questions or provide additional information, in the event the member expresses interest or asks questions.
Ask Questions: Meetings should be seen as two-way streets with a two-way information flow. If possible, take the opportunity to find out where the member and his/her staff stand on our issues.
Follow Up: Follow up the meeting with a thank you letter that outlines the different points covered during the meeting, and send along any additional information and materials requested.
Phone Calls
Unless you have a personal relationship with the legislator you are calling, ask to be referred to the staff member responsible for health issues or funding. Keep in mind that congressional offices receive hundreds of calls each day — be brief and to the point. You can always follow up with more information by mail. To reach any Washington congressional office, phone 202-224-3121 and ask for your legislator by name.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.

It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,
Lynn Barclay

We have a lot of relationships in our lives: family members, neighbors, friends, romantic partners and more. Romantic relationships are an important part of that. They can bring us companionship and intimacy.  But, while it’s important that dating partners care for each other, it’s just as important that you take care of yourself! In order to do this, we must be able to recognize when a relationship is healthy and when it is not.
In a healthy relationship, both partners:
Are treated with kindness and respect
Are honest with each other
Like to spend time together
Take an interest in things that are important to each other
Respect one another’s emotional, physical and sexual limits
Can speak honestly about their feelings
What does an unhealthy relationship look like? What about abuse? Follow this link to find out.

Search this websiteRecognize Problems
It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

ASHA, in collaboration with WebMD and The Yellow Umbrella Organization, has developed a new resource for WedMD called HPV Vaccine: Protect Yourself and Your Kids.
This new resource is for parents and other caregivers of children, adolescents, and young adults. It’s also for others who want to learn more about HPV. The goal is to help people learn about the virus and the conditions it can cause.
Two short programs cover the basics of HPV, including who gets it and how, what cancers it can cause, and who should get the HPV vaccine and when. Short videos in the program feature Christine Baze, a cervical cancer survivor and executive director of The Yellow Umbrella Organization, and a Dr. Rachel Caskey, associate professor of internal medicine and pediatrics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who talks about the HPV and how the vaccine prevents HPV-related disease, including cancer.
Visit WebMD to learn more about HPV, vaccination, and why it matters.

Volunteer Spotlight
NJ Chapter Leader Sandy Fischer, second from left, and chapter volunteers gear up for the chapter’s annual Halloween 5K.
Sandy Cowan Fischer, current chapter leader of the NCCC New Jersey Chapter in Montclair, has worked tirelessly to help spread awareness about cervical cancer prevention and the importance of early detection. The New Jersey Chapter was originally founded by Cristina Lucchetti Ryan in memory of her best friend, CaryAnne Cowan, a mother and life-long New Jersey resident who lost her life to cervical cancer in 2007. CaryAnne’s sister Sandy became involved with the New Jersey Chapter in 2009 and as chapter leader has done incredible work to raise awareness and spread the word about cervical cancer prevention. The New Jersey Chapter’s signature event, its annual 5K Halloween fundraiser, has helped the chapter raise funds to promote its educational efforts and, most significantly, allowed the chapter to award $5,000 to a local health center to support free Pap tests for women in need.
Thank you, Sandy, and all of the NJ Chapter volunteers for your efforts to prevent cervical cancer and save lives!

I suffer from a stigma, not a disease.
I have had HSV-1 since I was a kid and HSV-2 since I was 19. I am 40 now. After all these years, I have this to share with anyone who’s been newly diagnosed with genital herpes: Do not be ashamed of yourself for having on your genitals what most people have on their mouths! It just doesn’t make sense. Most people have this virus on their mouths, and yet we don’t shame them, make them self-disclose before each kiss, think they are dirty, or get scared of kissing them between outbreaks!
If I had a magic wand I would get rid of herpes stigma. I would do this even before I’d use the magic wand to create a herpes cure. This infection rarely cause me any trouble. I’ve had flea bites that hurt worse than an outbreak. What I suffer from is people’s judgement and ignorance. And I’ve been very lucky — in 20 years of having this virus, few people have rejected me, and were polite when they did. I’ve heard terrible horror stories about the kind of rejection others have gotten. And it’s simply not fair, not logical, and doesn’t follow medical facts.
I used to get angry by the rejection. It’s a very small risk at an infection that causes mild symptoms! But what they really risk is catching something that stigmatizes them. They don’t want to catch the stigma. No one wants to suffer from the stigma, and it’s the stigma we need to fight.
Don’t be ashamed! You’re still as good and worthy and beautiful as you were before.
I was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999 . . .I’m a gay man who was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999. Fortunately I only experienced a short-term (or acute) infection and am fine. Hepatitis B can be really serious, though, and I know I’m fortunate. Each and every gay man should have the hepatitis B vaccine. I wish I had gotten it when I was younger. Learn from me, and get your hep B shots! Take an HIV test. Use condoms. Don’t depend just on what the medical community says to do, take control and do something!
I have chlamydia . . .
I’m 19 years old and I have chlamydia. I was diagnosed with it last year, and have been treated. I feel like I was very stupid at the time I got it. I was 18, had a boyfriend who I thought loved me. I thought sex would make him treat me better. Big mistake. I cry every night and hardly sleep as I fear I let it go too far before getting treated, and I might not be able to have children.
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old.
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old. At first the doctors told me it was nothing to worry about, that it would probably go away on its own. I had no idea at the time what type of HPV I had nor did I know that some types of the virus are linked to cervical cancer. No one told me! I had normal Paps for 3 years after that and it did not seem like a big deal until at 28 I was diagnosed with CIN-3 [significant cervical pre-cancer] and had a LEEP. That freaked me out big time. I went through all the common feelings of guilt and shame. I told potential sexual partners about HPV and I did not have one guy freak out on me. They were all really cool about it. It helps that since men don’t have a cervix, there really is no real fear of cancer–the incidence of HPV-related penile cancer is extremely low.
At the end of the day, I don’t know who gave me HPV and I don’t really care anymore. What I do know is that in some ways HPV has been a very positive thing in my life. Having HPV taught me how to speak up and be honest, how to take care of myself better (stress is an aggravating factor) and most of all, to become my own advocate. To all of you out there struggling with this diagnosis, know that you are not alone. Millions of people have HPV, even if they don’t talk about it. You are not damaged or defective in any way. You are perfect just as you are. Take some deep breaths and know that everything is going to be OK!
My HPV diagnosis
I went for my routine yearly check up but this time I went to a different gynecologist thinking that it will be just another boring consultation where they just make me uncomfortable. Dr. Watson started explaining what HPV is and how many women die of cervical cancer, she also said that she only uses the liquid Pap test as it is more accurate than the conventional Pap test. With the innovation of the liquid pap test, 100 percent of the sample is sent to the lab. This means technicians have more cells to make a determination from and have a clearer sample to look at. Lab technicians who read these slides say the difference is like night and day between the traditional Pap and the new liquid technology. I just heard “blah-blah-blah” and couldn’t wait to leave. Dr. Watson looked at me and with a very strict voice said, “Women are not educated enough about these things and think ‘It can’t happen to me.'” This is when I though, “Well I’m very healthy so it cannot happen to me.” I went home waiting for the little piece of paper to arrive in the post saying “normal” but instead Dr. Watson phoned me a week later to make an appointment for a biopsy as there were pre-cancerous cells detected caused by HPV.
Suddenly everything stopped. My busy day at work did not matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore. I can die for crying out loud!! My head was spinning with all these questions. I was so angry to think that I did go for my normal Pap test every year and wasted all that money because not once did they pick it up?
After a long 4 day wait I went back to the gynecologist. I was strapped in like a horse when she performed the biopsy and promised myself never to complain again when going for a Pap test. Dr. Watson phoned me a few days later as she needed to discuss the results with me and that she has scheduled an operation. My whole world stopped again. I could believe my ears. The test results showed that I have HPV type 16 and CIN III, the liquid test only showed CIN II. The worst part was when she said that if she cannot get everything out, I will have to go for a hysterectomy after three months, which means no babies! I’m 27 years old and she is telling me no babies!! I was hysterical.
While lying on the operating table I thought of all the people having such a jolly time with their families, it’s not fair but I know my life is much more worth than a slice of Christmas cake. I am one lucky girl as Dr. Watson confirmed the operation to be very successful, the end is almost here!!
Getting testedI have been intimate with my girlfriend for almost two years now and as of a couple of months ago, I noticed warts growing in the area where the penis meets the groin. I don’t have what most people commonly refer to as a clear complexion, quite the opposite really, and that’s precisely what I took these growths to be. I had begun shaving in the pubic area as an intimate courtesy and it was only through this shaving that I first noticed the growths. My history of bad skin coupled with the added irritation of shaving led me to believe these growths were a natural reaction.
After a week or two of unchanged status in the warts I went to the city clinic where I endured the gambit of STD testing as well as a visual examination of the growths. The doctor offered an acid treatment, but recommended a consultation for laser surgery, in which case, she preferred I had nothing done at this point. I don’t have health insurance and although I called and made an appointment at the city hospital, I don’t foresee laser removal as a realistic option.
Here is where the story gets a little strange. Two weeks ago, my girlfriend scheduled an HPV/Pap test to check herself out. One week ago she received the results: negative! Negative?? Prior to communicating my concerns for my own health I had revealed to my girlfriend that she was my first and only, despite comments I may have made that made it sound I were a bit more seasoned in intimate relationships. This fact is true. I have nothing to gain (and everything to lose) by lying about this further. So I found myself in a precarious situation which almost wanted her test to come out positive so we knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what was happening to me and if it was serious.
I scheduled for more testing at a clinic closer to where I lived in the suburbs. The visual examination here was much more definitive and decisive. The doctor immediately identified the growths as genital warts and treated them immediately with acid. I am to return to the clinic for continued treatments until the warts disappear. But now my girlfriend is left in a situation even more ambiguous than when we began. I explained the test results to the doctor at the second clinic to which she said that “It didn’t matter,” and she could still have some kind of lesion that caused this in the first place.
Our situation never degenerated into rampant distrust. I knew she had multiple partners in the past and she knew of my virginity after revealing it later on. I still love her very much, perhaps even now more so because revealing this to other family and friends and relying on their support would shame me to an exponential level. I could never live with that knowledge in their hands. This is something I must hide from all others in my life, but found the need to tell my tale during research into diagnosis and treatment. Here are the most important things I learned from this experience thus far:
It is much better to have health insurance and consequently, doctors and staff who seem more interested in wanting to actually help you.
People that work in the clinics are very focused on HIV testing. If you want them to look or test for something else, you MUST TELL THEM and you can only do that by doing some research on your own first. Again, bear in mind these doctors are more like factory line workers with your problems as opposed to a PCP.
Go for a second opinion, especially if the first one is free.
If you must keep things quiet to other friends and family, your partner is your only support. Continue to love him or her or end the relationship quickly!
Although some clinics have “counselors,” they are not the sort that actually talk to you and try to make you feel better after a positive viral diagnosis. This will require a LOT of soul searching if you don’t have a shrink and almost unbearable if you are not speaking with your partner.
I thought I was invincibleLike many, I was/am pretty well educated on STDs. However, I still felt that I was “invincible” to sexual diseases and NEVER would have expected to get one.
I have had three partners—all long-term serious relationships. At age seventeen, I’m not what most would expect an “HPV infected person(s)” to be. I graduated two years early, I was a cheerleader for my college, I graduated high school with a 4.0, I’ve held 2 state beauty pageant titles, and currently hold a local title on my way to state! The important thing is—NO ONE is invincible, and it can happen to ANYBODY. That’s part of the risk we take being sexually active.
In my case, knowledge is power. I discovered “skin-tag-like” warts on and around my vaginal opening. I figured it was an allergic reaction to a bubble bath or something. After a week of no improvements, I did research on genital warts on the internet. I was almost positive I had them. I told me mother and we went to the doctor, and I am now undergoing treatment.
Unlike many others, I was able to trace the source of my STD. It was my first boyfriend and first partner. He had no idea he was carrying the virus (since there are often no symptoms). Since me, he has had over 10 partners…meaning possibly infecting over 10 people. They say, “You sleep with whoever your partner has slept with.” Never has the saying affected me more. I called him and told him what I had, what he had, what he should do (regarding telling his past partners), treatment he should seek, and other key facts. Once again, knowledge is power.
I also called my most recent ex and partner in addition to the first. I was screamed at, and cursed, and he even threatened to kill me. It brought out a side I had never seen. It hurt, but I did the right thing. I now understand why STD prevention may be difficult–it is hard to tell someone, especially when you get such a harsh reaction. I can’t lie. It was embarrassing, heartbreaking, and shameful. But as I told him, STDs are just one part of the risk we take from being sexually active, especially as teens.
Now to my third partner—my fiance. I have infected him. We are going to a clinic (so his parents won’t find out) next week for him. Luckily there are many low cost and even free STD screening and treatment centers for cases just like this. It was so hard for us to get through this. He, unlike me, waited for “the one” before having sex. Being honored, I never once thought that I might be capable of transmitting a disease to him. As he put it at first, “It’s like working and working and working hard for something your whole life- and then having it blow up in your face.”
Yes, I gave my love an STD. The “perfect” varsity player with perfect grades. We found out that knowledge/education and communication is key. Though my communication issues were a bit more than just between us, it was something that had to be done. Something to think about. My first partner was angry, and so embarrassed, he refuses to tell the 10+ people he slept with. Assuming they follow a pattern, in a years span (since he started having sex with others)- they sleep with three males. That’s over 30 people infected because of someone not speaking the truth.
I have HPV. So does my fiance. We are normal- perhaps even considered “exceptional”—college students. His past: 0 partners. My past: 2 partners. All protected sex. We have HPV for the rest of my life. But we get through it together.
Rape and HPVAbout a year and one month ago, my high school coach raped me. He was my idol, my mentor, and one of my closest friends. He helped me to believe in myself, helped get me a scholarship to run at a university, and then helped me to train for my first season as a college athlete. I tried to push him off of me, but I guess it doesn’t matter.
Afterwards, I walked to my car, put my head down on my steering wheel and hyperventilated for a while— disbelief is what I like to call it. “Everyone has a skeleton and a closet to keep it in”—he’s mine. I wonder if he knows what he did. A few months later, I was diagnosed with HPV. He took everything from me, but at least he gave me something in return. “You’ve left me with nothing, but I’ve worked with less.”
Growing up in a life filled with sexual abuse and betrayal, my only defense is to forget…even when it’s happening. HPV makes it hard to forget – I am defenseless, now. When I was diagnosed, my doctor told me nothing about what I had and treated it as if it was nothing. I guess it probably was for her – she wasn’t on that table in nothing but a hospital gown. She didn’t shiver on top of that crinkly white paper while someone stuck something up inside her – maybe I shouldn’t have cared either. All these years I have been alone in my struggle with self-respect and trust. I have kept quiet, leaving my pain in little jars that I sometimes like to touch, trying to remember what it’s like to feel.
“I’ve been treated so wrong, I’ve been treated so long as if I’m becoming untouchable.” My saving grace was the hope that one day I would be far enough from my experiences that they wouldn’t hurt anymore. Last May, all of that changed with the diagnosis of HPV – a silent reminder of the pain that will follow me the rest of my life.
I recently entered into a relationship with the man that I hope to be my husband one day. He has been infinitely patient with me and with all of my fears. The second date we went on, we sat in the dark after watching a movie. Upon request, he gave me a pen and a piece of paper and waited while I scrawled a note to him stating that I had been raped and that I had HPV. I told him that he could take me or leave me, but to do it now. He didn’t leave.
The past couple of days, this “infection” has been especially painful…both physically and mentally. I had never realized that HPV could lead to cervical cancer – no one ever told me. I found out when a commercial came on TV about asking for the HPV test. I spent many nights doing research before the ad came on TV, but I just got frustrated and felt more and more disgusting. I couldn’t see through my tears to really understand what I was reading. When I saw that ad, it was as if someone had lifted a curtain and light came shining through.
The man I spoke of previously sent me an email today, with a link to this website in it. He pleaded with me to just take a look. He tried to tell me that I shouldn’t be ashamed, that I wasn’t alone.
I don’t really know where I’m going with this and I know that you will cut this down if you decide to put it up on your site. It’s ok even if you decide not to put it up at all. I’m not going to read over what I’ve written so that I don’t decide not to send it. Whoever you are, you’re one of the precious few that has any idea that this has happened to me. I’m sorry if this has been hard to understand… I’m just tired of silence. I just want someone to know.
I knew it was a risk for my health but...I’ve been dating the same boy for 10 years. We’ve been together since we were 16. This is the boy I’m willing to marry; the only one I’ve ever loved. Two years ago, I met a man who was 12 years my senior and completely drove me crazy. For the first time in my life I was going to be unfaithful. We had unprotected intercourse. I perfectly knew it was a risk for my health but…in those moments I did not care.
In February this year I went on for my annual Pap test and I found out I have HPV. I did not know anything about this disease. That man gave it to me. At first I thought my life was ruined, I had to talk with my boyfriend and with my father, who’s a doctor. So I did. It’s been difficult but my boyfriend decided to support me and he s still fighting with me, despite I could give him HPV. Today I’ve been told that I have high risk HPV, so I decided to write my story. HPV won’t let me down, I’ll fight and I’ll win. I thank God for my boyfriend support, and I thank your website for all your precious information.
Knowing that I’m not alone has made me feel normal againI just found out about a month ago that I have the type of HPV that causes warts. It had been six months since I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years so needless to say it was a another sting to an open wound, since I had not been with anyone since our breakup. I was so scared and angry when diagnosed. I’m 29 now and I had always been aware of STDs, and I made my last two boyfriends get checked for STDs before I had unprotected sex. Little did I know about HPV and that men could be carriers and not know it.
I racked my brain for so long to try and figure out who gave it to me…was it my boyfriend…did he cheat on me…did he already have it and not know it…did I have it before we dated and not know it?? I have finally been able to release all of those questions because I know it only adds stress to my life and will not make the HPV go away.
I’m still working on clearing the warts and regaining my spirit and health. I know in time it will all work out and it has defiantly made me respect my body that much more. Of the three friends that I talked to about my HPV, two of them confided that they have the high-risk HPV. Knowing that I’m not alone has really helped and has made me feel normal again.
I’m still scared to date and unsure how to deal with this. Two doctors I have spoken to have told me that in the beginning as long as I’m using condoms and I’m wart free I don’t need to tell anyone. But I wear my heart on my sleeve and I just don’t think I could be intimate with someone without them knowing. Plus at this point in my life I don’t feel the need to have sex with anyone until I know them well enough to have an STD talk. After all I still have to respect my body and do the best I can to protect myself from other STDs, and anyone that does not respect that is not someone I want to be intimate with.
'I encourage physicians to be honest with their patientsI was married for 20 years and my regular Pap smears were always normal. When a “no-fault” divorce completely traumatized my life, I was under tremendous stress. At one point I was working 7 days a week while going back to college full-time in order to get my degree, while at the same time running a household and raising a teenage son. (No-fault divorce has eliminated alimony and in many cases even child support; I was supporting my son and myself on a $10/hr job. Thanks to no-fault divorce laws, I did not qualify for food stamps either, or any other assistance.)
To make a long story short, I went for a Pap smear a year ago, and I was shocked to find that the result was abnormal. I couldn’t imagine how I could have contracted a sexually transmitted disease.
My family physician probably did not want to alarm me, so he merely suggested that I follow a regimen of special douches for a few months and then come back to see him after that. However, he did not tell me I had HPV. I assumed it was a minor problem such as a chronic yeast infection—although I was not experiencing any symptoms—so I did not go back. He did not call to follow-up, either. I changed jobs and doctors, and the first thing I did was go for a physical with a Pap smear; I was curious to see whether that yeast infection had disappeared. When the Pap smear was abnormal again, I was scared. And, I was angry with my previous physician for not telling me the facts. Had I known the abnormal Pap smear meant HPV, I certainly would have followed up with a treatment program.
I would encourage all physicians to be honest with their patients, and to provide information about HPV with every Pap smear.
Most importantly, I believe that stress is the reason for my suppressed immune system. More research needs to focus on the effects of stress on health. Thank you.
What a roller coaster ride this has beenI just want to take a moment to thank everyone who wrote in and to share my story. I was just diagnosed with high-risk HPV yesterday. What a roller coaster ride this has been. I received a call about about two weeks ago from my gynecologist’s secretary, in an OB/GYN practice, that I had to make an appointment to discuss my results. How nerve-wrecking it was to get a phone call like that. What made the whole situation worse is that I could not come in for my appointment until more than a week and a half later.
I tried to get as much information as possible about my results from the secretary and was told–in a not so pleasant way-—”all I can tell you is that is has something to do with your Pap smear.” So, I made the appointment and and tried to go on with business as usual…but of course I couldn’t. I did tons of internet searches on Pap Smear results and soon discovered HPV. After doing as much reading as I could possibly do, I came to the conclusion that I had HPV.
What is sad is that I am a public health professional and did not know about high-risk HPV. I only associated HPV with genital warts. I never knew that there was an HPV that was wart-less and caused cervical cancer. I know I made some not-too-bright decisions regarding my sexual activity, but for the most part I have always been pretty careful. I was regularly tested for STDs and had my partners tested for STDs when we started having a sexual relationship. I have only had 3 sexual partners and did not lose my virginity until I was 23. I’m 28 now.
When my doctor diagnosed me yesterday with HPV, even though I knew that this diagnosis was a very strong possibility, I was absolutely shocked. I have never had an STD before. I spent most of yesterday in a daze and remained in complete disbelief for the remainder of the day. But today is a brand new day and I am filled with brand new hope.
I want everyone on this website to feel as comfortable with being diagnosed with HPV as I now do. The truth is that almost every sexually active person will be diagnosed with HPV at some point in their lives…and it is not the end of the world. In fact, HPV testing is not a standard screen because it is so common. It doesn’t make sense to make a big deal out of it if its not causing any problems…which is often the case. But when an abnormal Pap Smear shows up, then you test for HPV so you can discover the origin of the abnormal cells. The good news is that regular Pap Smears can stop the progression of abnormal cells in their tracks. What’s even better news is that a healthy immune system naturally fights HPV and most people will test negative for HPV within a year or two—or even less.
The thing is, the virus is so common, its possible that you can be infected several times. The key for women is to be sure to have Pap tests regularly. Men, apparently you’re not affected at all by high-risk HPV. There are no clinical manifestations for you and no tests to determine if you have it. But you can give it to your sexual partner and if your partner has a cervix, it can infect her cervix and lead to abnormal cell growth.
I say all of this to say… KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT!!!
My miscarriageI found out I was infected with chlamydia a few months ago. About 2 months before that I was pregnant with my first child, which now I have found out that I miscarried my child because I was infected. I advise all to use protection as i can tell you it was hard enough finding out I had chlamydia let alone finding out it was the cause of my miscarriage! Now I have tried to fall pregnant again…I was extremely fertile before I had chlamydia and now I can’t even fall pregnant again. I’ve decided to just give my body a rest and just hope that I can conceive again. And to make things worse I will never no how long I had the infection for as my past partners refuse to be tested! So I’m stuck wandering who I caught it from and who I may have given it to. I had no symptoms that I noticed then now I know more about it I can say why didn’t I think something was wrong before!! It was because I didn’t know about it. I just hope that people will read this and think more carefully when going out or having sex because you always say to yourself “Oh well that’ll never happen to me,” and then it does and it ruins your life!
Thank you and I hope my story can help people to realize that you can get it and it can happen to you!
Why can't teens get tested?My name is Christina and I’m a 16 year old sophomore in high school. During my first year in high school I engaged in sexual activities. Ever since then, things haven’t been the same. I really want to go to a clinic and get tested for HIV/AIDS and STDs but I’m scared to let my parents know that I’m sexually active. No clinics would let me get tested without my parents and that’s a huge problem!
Many of my peers are going through the same thing with me. We want to get tested but refuse to tell our parents. This isn’t so good because, what if we are infected? How would we know? Would the infection only get worse? Well the point I’m trying to get across is that, there should clinics for teens to go to without their parents to get tested. I’m not saying this just because I’m terrified of my parents, but it’s been a thought on my mind for a while. Most teens would rather sit and let their infection grow other than telling their parents to take them to a clinic. Pregnancy testing shouldn’t be the only thing a teen can do without their parents’ consent. Please give me some feedback, maybe there are clinics that I don’t know about.
Editors note: You can search for a clinic that offers STD testing near you.
You made me feel like a person, not a statisticI am a 25 year old woman that was diagnosed with HPV about 2 months ago. I received an abnormal Pap smear result. I told my boyfriend at the time what was going on, and he flipped out, blaming me and yelling that I gave him this virus. I went for the colposcopy, and found out I had mild-moderate dysplasia and would have to have a LEEP procedure. I was terrified. I asked how I got the virus and what it was. When my doctor told me it was an STD, I started crying, thinking it was impossible. I had several partners in the past years, but made sure I always wore a condom and had thought I was being very careful. My doctor then explained to me that condom use does not always protect against HPV. I was outraged. I felt that for years, people have been lied to in a way. Education about sex and condoms does not include the fact that condoms do not protect against HPV.
The emotional strain this put on my relationship caused us to break up. I went in shortly thereafter for my LEEP procedure. I have been healing for about three weeks and am going for a checkup soon. I am scared that the Pap smear will come back abnormal again. I talked with my doctor previously to the LEEP and he found in my past Pap smears (dating 3 years ago), there was dysplasia present, just not severe enough to treat. They had assumed it would go away by itself. It is inconclusive if the strain I have now is recurrent or a new one, but it’s startling to think I have had this for so long without even knowing it.
In the past couple weeks, I started a relationship with another guy, and the subject of past sexual history came up. I took a chance and told him about the HPV, explaining what it was and how it’s contracted. He was very understanding, and admitted he had heard of the effects of the virus, but had never heard of HPV. The question still remains whether or not to abstain from sex, we have really hit it off and things are moving at a nice pace, but it was heart wrenching to tell him what was going on with me. I believe I got lucky with his reaction, as there is such a stigma surrounding the idea of contracting a STD. It is important people are educated on the fact that this is not your normal STD. Even with precautions, it is very contagious. I feel better knowing that myself, but I also feel people will not find out about this unless they are infected.
I do want to thank you for posting un-biased information on HPV. You made me feel like a person again, not a statistic.
HIV and TBAt fifteen I started playing high school sports. I was the average athlete playing basketball, football, and baseball. I was to my high school piers known as a square because I did not curse, drink, party or do drugs. I was voted ”Most Friendly” by my senior class at Lexington High. I was proud of my accomplishment in high school. I lettered in three varsity sports, I was voted MVP of the baseball team my senior year and I was told by my basketball coach before graduation that many things in life would come easier for me because I had God on my side.
At age 24, I started my career in hotel management, continued coaching little league and singing gospel music along the east coast. At age 28 is when I came “out of the closet” to my parents that I was gay and I was condemned to hell from my family. It was then that I left Lexington and moved to North Carolina continuing my career in hotel management, continuing my singing and visiting churches that loved me even though I was gay and allowed me to worship with them.
It is now the year 2000. I moved to Richmond and I met my life partner Brad in March and started a relationship that has blessed me tremendously. Have we had problems? Yes, the devil intervened and not being able to find a church that I was happy with, I backslid.
Four years later on July 22, 2004 at 7:00AM. While working 11-7 that night I developed some health problems that I had to seek medical attention for. It was then that I was diagnosed with HIV. I can still remember how I felt those first few minutes after the doctor had told me I had HIV. My partner Brad stood in the window waiting for some bad news but he never expected this bad news. So many questions crossed my mind at that time. Was my partner of 4 years going to leave me? How long was I going to live? Who gave it to me? What were my parents going to say? How many friends will I loose? It was a month later after having a biopsy that I was told also that not only did I have HIV but I had tuberculosis.
For months after my diagnosis I was bedridden. The side affect that I had from my HIV and TB medications were so severe that I remember telling my partner, “if this is what it takes to survive, I’m not sure I want to live”. Not able to eat anything solid for months I lost 39 pounds.
The good news is since my diagnosis I have found my reason for living. I don’t believe my health problems are because I am gay but because I needed a wake up call from God to get back into the ministry. The wake up call worked.
STD vs. STII am a health teacher at the high school level and I feel that changing STD to STI makes the issue not as important. Students see STI as something similar to a sinus infection, ear infection, yeast infection. All things that are curable and do not have long term side effects or cause other health issues (HPV/AIDS/genital warts—effect on babies born vaginally, etc.). This sends a very confusing message to the students. They understand that STDs are much more serious and view STIs as not that big of an issue because of the word “infection” vs. “disease.”
I would consider the thought process of a teenager (middle school-12-13 years old and high school 13-18). These are the groups that are having sex and not using protection. These students need to understand the implications of the choices of they make and changing meanings and definitions are just going to confuse the issue. Please reconsider the change from STD to STI.
Telling potential partners is terribly hardAt first i didn’t really think i had a problem. I went to a woman’s clinic a few weeks after I found out my boyfriend had cheated on me with at least 2 people. I told her I just wanted to make sure I hadn’t caught anything from him. About a month before I had met him (so would be 9 months up to that point) I had gone for my annual pap test and there were no problems. One week after that pap test I received a call from the doctor telling me that I was to see a GYN doc as i had signs of “pre-cancerous cells” on my cervix.
I went to the doctor and he performed some biopsies taking 4 pieces from my cervix which hurt tremendously. Another week went by and I received a call telling me that I had all 3 signs of precancerous cells on my cervix, calling it dysplasia (not one word of HPV or whatever I had). I was then scheduled for cervical laser surgery and told that it should take care of all my problems. The follow up pap was supposed to be 3 months after the surgery but due to cancellations and delays and emergencies (was supposed to be August ended up late February the next year). This time the follow up was with my family doctor and as I was having the pap I asked him about these really small itchy bumps I could feel there and I wanted to know what they were.
He told me rather abruptly and without care “The doctor had to have told you that you have HPV and also genital warts when he treated you right?” Well let’s just say my mouth dropped and I was stunned. I not only didn’t know that I had HPV I had no clue I had genital warts until that moment and I really didn’t even understand what he said. I came home and started reading up on it and as you can imagine i became increasingly upset. I hadn’t been with anyone for 8 years before this guy, and had never had an abnormal pap before that. I was devastated, he put me on Aldara for 16 weeks and all it did was make them itchier and larger. He then determined to laser them off. The healing for that took a month and now I am scarred with pigment loss where all the lesions were. I have had a few come back which have been acid removed but still it’s one of the most depressing, hardest things I have ever had to deal with. Telling potential partners is terribly hard.
I haven’t seen any in about 7 months now so hoping it’s finally, hopefully, going to clear up as far as being there visibly. I have been dealing with this for 5 years now and not sure if it will ever end. I have heard of a few here who have gotten this HPV and because they are lesion-free for 6 months they feel they have gotten rid of it, therefore not telling partners about it. I am totally upset about the misconceptions about this STD, as it gets so many people and they don’t think anything of it.
When I told one of the girls where I worked that I had pre-cancerous cells on my cervix she matter of fact told me that she’s had that done 4 times. I don’t think she was aware of how bad this can be. Unfortunately for me I was passed on at least 2 types, the low risk and the high risk and I was not informed by my own doctor at the time. By the doctor taking a year to tell me I feel that was irresponsible as I may have infected someone in that year.
That’s what happened to me, hopefully they will come up with something that will get rid of this in people who already have it and not just prevent it from happening. Thank you for reading my story.
Why isn't there more awareness?I am 23 years old and have only been sexually active for one year. My first partner and I went to the city clinic to be tested for HIV and STDs. When they told us we were negative on everything I thought there was nothing else to worry about. I got on the pill and we made it a point to always use a condom. I thought I was being safe but little did I know there was something called HPV and my boyfriend at the time carried the virus. I went for a routine pap three months ago and was told that I had HPV and that it was in its 3rd stage of its growth (the fourth is cancer). I went through a freezing process in hope that it would remove my abnormal cells. My cells regenerated and I’m incredibly upset that i never heard about this (HPV) until I had it. Why wasn’t there more awareness? Why can’t we find more ways to test men? If I had known my ex-boyfriend carried the virus I wouldn’t have slept with him. I am mad that now I have deal with this condition and go through further treatments simply because there wasn’t enough awareness to warn me.
How did I end up with an STD?I am 34 years old. I have been married for 6 years and have had only one sex partner who is my husband in my life. I have two beautiful kids, a girl and a boy. I recently got diagnosed with genital warts. I am so confused, frustrated, sad, angry, worried and stress. My life seems over. I think it will be hard for me to find full happiness again. Genital warts, the ugly stuff, will always be staying in the back of my mine.
I strongly believe in monosex partner in life time and have been practicing my belief. Here I am ended up with a STD.
Silent diseases are easy to ignoreI was first diagnosed with high-risk HPV about a year and a half ago, with the discovery of genital warts on a follow-up visit after biopsy. Even though I consider myself relatively well-informed and compassionate on the subject of STD transmission (i.e. they aren’t necessarily caught due to promiscuous behavior, I didn’t think any less of someone who had one), I wasn’t prepared for the feelings of shame, guilt, and fear I experienced.
Although I tried to go in for a colposcopy as soon as possible, in hindsight I was not emotionally prepared. The doctor, who was highly recommended but simply average at my visit, could not perform a biopsy because I was physically shaking. At the time, I was dealing with graduation from college, a love affair gone wrong, problems with anxiety, and the fact that I now had an STD. The reason many women find putting off treatment a viable option most likely has to do with the fact that their diagnosis is hidden. To this day most of my friends, not to mention my family, do not know that I have been treated for cervical dysplasia and genital warts. Even if a person has every good intention to seek treatment, having to live with a disease as a secret makes it that much more terrifying to admit that, “yes, I have an STD,” when it comes time to make those appointments.
I do not consider myself squeamish or easily intimidated by gynecological exams, but every time I went in to get treated I was overcome with feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. I also moved to a new city in the interim, and it took nearly four months to get all my paperwork in one place even though my boyfriend worked at the institute where my new gynecologist is. I can only imagine how hard it is for everyone who has to get their records in order without professional help.
I would also postulate that because HPV is an invisible epidemic, it is easier to go without treatment. Silent diseases are easy to ignore. Thanks to the work done on AIDS, cancer, and other high-profile diseases, no one would argue that anyone with these diseases should put off treatment. But for ailments such as HPV, thryoid dysfunction, and PMDD (which, interestingly enough, all of whose effects are more prominent or only occur in women), many people go throughout their lives without even a diagnosis, much less full treatment.
Thank you again for providing this valuable resource. Every article or new statistic we have access to allows us to shed a bit more secrecy and come to accept both the fact of having HPV, and preparing ourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally for all necessary treatment.
HPV TestI was twenty three and had not had a pap in over 2 years when I went. My test came back abnormal so I then had to get another test done which was a HPV test and that came back positive. My cells were at a high level for cancer. I had to get my cervix froze hoping it would remove all the abnormal and cancer cells. I had to go back to the doctor three months later to get another test which thankful came back negative. I’m thankful every day that this was detected because I’m not sure what might have happened. Please ask for the test when you get your pap. It can and will save your life.

A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.

Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.

Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.

Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.

Volunteer Spotlight
NJ Chapter Leader Sandy Fischer, second from left, and chapter volunteers gear up for the chapter’s annual Halloween 5K.
Sandy Cowan Fischer, current chapter leader of the NCCC New Jersey Chapter in Montclair, has worked tirelessly to help spread awareness about cervical cancer prevention and the importance of early detection. The New Jersey Chapter was originally founded by Cristina Lucchetti Ryan in memory of her best friend, CaryAnne Cowan, a mother and life-long New Jersey resident who lost her life to cervical cancer in 2007. CaryAnne’s sister Sandy became involved with the New Jersey Chapter in 2009 and as chapter leader has done incredible work to raise awareness and spread the word about cervical cancer prevention. The New Jersey Chapter’s signature event, its annual 5K Halloween fundraiser, has helped the chapter raise funds to promote its educational efforts and, most significantly, allowed the chapter to award $5,000 to a local health center to support free Pap tests for women in need.
Thank you, Sandy, and all of the NJ Chapter volunteers for your efforts to prevent cervical cancer and save lives!

There are inherent risks in everyday life. Being sexual with someone also carries risks—risk of rejection, of unwanted pregnancy, of contracting a sexually transmitted disease/infection (STD/STI) or even a simple cold. Here we will examine some of the things you can do to assess your own risks and benefits so that you can enjoy the benefits important to you while decreasing your risk of contracting an STD/STI, having an unwanted pregnancy, or being coerced into sexual activity.
Decide on Your Boundaries
It is not possible to make an accurate, generalized statement about the “ideal” number of partners or the “absolute- best” choices to make about condoms, barriers, and other forms of birth control. However, by talking to your partner(s), it is possible to make the “best” decisions about protection and birth control for you. There may be no “best” way for everyone, but there are some choices that will work better for you and your partner(s) than others.
When deciding on their boundaries, people may consider such things as:
religious beliefs
cultural standards
personal desires and comfort levels
the type of relationship in which one is involved
the level of trust
communication and commitment within a relationship
the physical and emotional benefits of sexual choices
the physical, emotional and risks of sexual choices
the emotional perceptions of actual physical risks
Before sexual activity, it is important to establish boundaries for yourself, share your boundaries with your partner, and listen to your partner(s) about his or her boundaries. This is crucial in make sure you are engaging in consensual sex. One important part of consent is making sure you are abiding by your partner’s comfort level in protecting against STIs, birth control, and sexual acts. Here’s an example: You and your partner are having sex after you bothst boundaries and agree to use a condom. Midway through sex, you partner takes off the condom without telling you. Your consent to sexual activity was dependent on using a condom. Since your boundaries were violated, the sex became unconsensual. To learn more about consent, visit this page of our website.
A Few Questions to Consider
What are your reasons for choosing to have sex? What are the “benefits” you are hoping to enjoy? (Physical health benefits? Pleasure? Emotional connection? Fun? Spiritual connection?)
When and how often will you be tested for sexually transmitted disease/infection (STD/STIs)?
When and how often do you want your partners to be tested for STD/STIs?
Which sexual activities are you willing to try? Which are you unwilling to do? Which might you be willing to try in some situations and/or with some partners but not others?
What barriers do you want to use? Under which circumstances?
What barriers and other precautions do you want your partner(s) to use when being sexual with others, if you are in a sexually non-monogamous relationship?
Are you willing to risk a possible pregnancy? If not, what method of birth control will you use?
Do you have a plan of action that you intend to follow if, in spite of precautions, you are faced with an unwanted pregnancy, or an STD/STI?

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.
How do I sign up?
Follow this link and create an account. Or sign up below! We are excited for you to join us!

Search this websiteSexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

ASHA’s definition of sexual health represents the ideal toward which ASHA works. But how close do we in the United States come to this ideal? Is the U.S. a sexually healthy nation? If not, what more can we do to be one? What does a sexually healthy nation look like?
We decided to ask a range of individuals, from experts in the field to people on the street, to try to answer that question. As part of commemorating our 100th anniversary in 2014, ASHA produced the video Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation, exploring how our views toward sex and sexuality have changed over the past century.
The video includes commentary from several notable experts in the field. Deborah Arrindell, vice president of health policy at ASHA, J. Dennis Fortenberry, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, Deb Hauser, president and CEO of Advocates for Youth, Debby Herbenick, sexual health educator for the Kinsey Institute, Beth Meyerson, assistant professor at Indiana University School of Public Health, and Michael Reece, co-director of the Indiana University Center for Sexual Health Promotion, offer their thoughts and opinions.

Search this websiteSelf Image
Your self-image is a mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and an individual. When you think about yourself, the feelings and images that come up are important. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves how you feel about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities.
Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image has a strong affect on our sexual health. By the same token, our feelings about our bodies can influence the way we think about ourselves as people. Self-image can change as we age, too, because our bodies change constantly as we move through life.
During puberty, abrupt shifts in our hormones cause these changes to happen very quickly, which can be both exciting and a little jarring. Acne may erupt on our skin as we adjust to a new stage of life.
From birth, men are conditioned to be socially, physically, and sexually dominant just as many women are caught in an unhealthy pursuit of a model-skinny figure.
Just like women, men need to recognize that bodies come in all different shapes and sizes. There is no one “right” body size. Your body is not, and should not be, exactly like anyone else’s.
The Influence of Media and Popular Culture
Body image is what you believe about your physical appearance. Images of beautiful men and women are displayed everywhere from billboards to television advertisements. Fortunately, everyone does not look the same. Looking at models and movie stars often create a negative self-image of one self in relation to these images.
Look around—magazines tend to focus on promoting weight lifting, bodybuilding or muscle toning. Having a body you can imagine on the cover of a magazine will not make you happy.
We see perfectly muscled bodies. “Is that what a real man is supposed to look like,” you may find yourself asking.
When men are dissatisfied, the main focuses of concern are height, stomachs, chests and hair loss. We may see them surreptitiously drawing in their stomachs and walking ‘taller’ as they pass the mirror.
From Boys to Men
Teenage boys are often obsessed with size, checking out each other in school locker rooms, worrying that others will tease them if they don’t “measure up” to some unwritten standard. This pressure goes side by side with insecurity fueled by everything from acne to not having a cool car or the prized brand of sneakers. Add in an overwhelming desire to fit in and you can see why a number of teen-age boys are a brooding brew of hormones and gangly limbs.
Penis size is determined entirely by factors out of our control. Yet penis size may be the single greatest cause of anxiety for men young and old. Questions about penis size abound; What’s the average penis size? Can I increase my penis size? Does penis size matter as much as I think it does? Some of these questions have easy answers, most of them don’t.
Males often underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others, because he is looking down. Studies have shown that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises.
As they age, men’s obsession with size may lessen. Men’s fixation with performance, however, may become more acute with age – especially if they experience any difficulty in that area. Sometimes a problem with a relationship can become, for the man, a problem he can solve by being “better” at sex. Of course, often the problems in relationships have little to nothing to do with the quality of sex.
Performance anxiety isn’t limited to physical sexual prowess, either. Men compare themselves to other guys when it comes to income and professional accomplishments as well. Much like their adolescent counterparts, men in their prime working years can view themselves as flawed if they don’t have the right car, a corner office, or don’t quite reach the same rung on the career ladder as their peers. An attractive partner hooked to the arm of an older, affluent, professionally successful man (who may be quite ordinary in looks and personality) can lead even a secure guy to tell himself “I should be there. What’s wrong with me?”
Middle Age and Beyond
As with other stages of life, older men have their own unique issues. America doesn’t take seniors and sex seriously. It’s often difficult to believe that older people — particularly senior men — may have vibrant, active sex lives. But they do. Of course, some things may not work the way they did in younger years but sex can still give meaning and satisfaction to older men who pursue physical relationships or who want to maintain and increase intimacy with a partner of many years.
When it comes down to it, the physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure.

These self-assessment tools are designed for young male and female patients – and targeted by age – to help provide a picture of overall health and wellbeing. This assessments can be shared with a healthcare provider as part of their well-child visit.
We suggest the young patient fill out the appropriate form for their age, print it, and hope they will feel free to bring it to discuss at their visit.
The information on the appropriate sheet will let the young patient know what to expect when they’re with the healthcare provider. There are also some questions for them to answer. These are meant to help them think about how they’re feeling physically and mentally, and to remind them about things they may want to talk about.

Search this websiteVaginal Health
The vagina is designed to keep itself clean with natural, healthy vaginal secretions. You can keep your vagina healthy with the same things that keep your whole body healthy—regular hygiene and a good diet. There are some basic dos and don’ts you can follow:
DON’T douche—it upsets the natural balance of the vagina. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggest that women steer clear of douching. Douching may make a woman more prone to vaginal infections.
DO wash your vaginal area with mild, unscented soap. There is no need to use anything special to clean the vulva and vagina. Rinse well and pat dry.
DO wipe your vagina and anus from front to back to avoid spreading germs.
DO take antibiotic medicine only when needed. Antibiotics can kill “good” bacteria in the vagina.
DO try to stay as dry as possible. To reduce sweating and moisture, wear cotton or cotton-lined underpants and avoid tight pants.
What Makes a Vagina “Healthy”?
Like many things in life, it’s all about balance. In a healthy vagina, there is a balance among many kinds of bacteria. That’s right—a healthy vagina is full of bacteria. Some kinds of bacteria are considered “good” while others are “bad.” Good bacteria help keep the vagina a little bit acidic. This keeps bad bacteria from growing too fast. Sometimes, though, the bad bacteria can take over and cause problems.
What can cause bacteria to get out of balance? Lots of things. Among them are antibiotics, douching, tight pants, vaginal products (sprays, lubricants, birth control devices), and pregnancy.
One sign that things are out of balance is discharge. Vaginal discharge isn’t always a problem—a healthy vagina does makes a discharge—slippery and clear or whitish when moist, may turn yellowish when dried, and has little odor. This healthy discharge may also be thicker during some parts of the month. Unhealthy discharge is different. It often has an odd color (yellow, greenish, gray or thick white) and may also have strong, unpleasant odor.
Discharge isn’t the only sign to watch out for, though. Swelling, itching or burning in and around the vagina can also signal a problem. These symptoms are referred to as vaginitis, a broad term to describe different types of vaginal infections. Vaginitis is very common, and most women will have vaginitis at some point in their lives—possibly several times.
While vaginitis can be caused by a sexually transmitted infection, like trichomoniasis, it is more often the result of an imbalance of bacteria. Two of the more common types of vaginitis are yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis (BV).
Click image to download our printable BV fact sheet
While yeast infections and BV have some similar symptoms—discharge, redness and irritation, odor—they are different infections, and need to be treated differently. A yeast infection is caused by a fungus called candida, which (like bacteria) is normally found in the vagina. Specific bacteria in the vagina (lactobacillus) help prevent an overgrowth of yeast. But when that bacterial balance is upset, the result can be an overgrowth of yeast. BV is also caused by an imbalance—again, when the “bad” bacteria greatly outnumber the “good.”
Treating Problems
Before you consider treatment for any vaginal problems, it’s important to know exactly what you’re dealing with. A healthcare provider can properly diagnose the cause of vaginitis and ensure you get the right treatment. While it can be tempting to self-diagnose and self-treat with over-the-counter products or natural remedies, many women misdiagnose the problem. In a recent survey conducted by ASHA, about 62% of women mistook BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis.
Correct diagnosis is important. Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase a woman’s risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Pregnant women can face additional problems, as BV may cause babies to be born early or with low birth weight.
To help diagnose what’s causing vaginitis, a healthcare provider will likely perform an exam and take a sample of vaginal discharge. They may examine the sample under a microscope in the office or send it to a lab to be tested.
Yeast infections can be treated with over-the-counter medications or prescription antifungals. Treatment for BV requires a prescription antibiotic by a healthcare provider. There are different options—including a gel or cream that can be inserted into the vagina, or medications that are taken orally. Some medications need to be taken over several days, while one newer treatment requires only a single dose.
Even when treatment works, BV can come back. It’s common for women to get BV again within a year of being treated. If BV does recur, a healthcare provider may suggest a long-term treatment strategy.
If you have symptoms of vaginitis, see your healthcare provider for a correct diagnosis. To help your provider find out what you have, prepare for the exam by following these tips:
Schedule the exam when you’re not having your monthly period.
Don’t douche 24 hours before your exam.
Don’t use vaginal sprays 24 hours before your exam.
If you have sex less than 24 hours before the exam, use condoms.
Listen to ASHA president and CEO Lynn Barclay and Dr. Noor Abualnadi of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine as they discuss the basic facts about BV, including why women get BV, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Most importantly, though, she talks about why self-diagnosis and home remedies can do more harm than good. Listen and learn why “less is more” should be the motto for vaginal health.

Most people think they would know if they had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) . . . wrong!
The truth is a person can have an STIs but have no signs or symptoms. Or they may have mild signs that can be easily overlooked. This is why the term “disease” (as in STD) is starting to be replaced by infection (or STI). The only way to know if you have an STI is to get tested.
Lots of people are confused about getting tested for STIs. For example, you may think your annual medical check-up will include tests for STIs, especially if your healthcare provider knows you are sexually active. The fact is that some providers might test for some infections when you come in for a regular check-up, while others do not test for any STI unless you ask them to.
If you’ve had unprotected sex, have a new partner (or more than one partner), or for any reason are worried you have been exposed to an STI, talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested be tested for these leading common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, herpes, HPV, syphilis and trichomoniasis. If your healthcare provider feels you do not need to be checked for some of these, you will at least know which ones you were tested for and which ones you were not.
Where can I get tested?
You can talk to your healthcare provider about testing, or you can search for a clinic near you using the search tool below (provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Just enter your zip code to find a local testing site.

How do STI tests work?
Getting tested can be quick and easy. Depending on what you are being tested for, your provider may take a blood sample, a swab, or ask you to pee in a cup. Easy! Here’s an idea of what to expect:
Chlamydia
How the test is done: Swab of genital area or urine sample
What you also need to know: If you have had oral or anal sex, let your healthcare provider know this also. These sites may be infected, but vaginal or urine samples may not be positive.
Gonorrhea
How the test is done: Swab of genital area or urine sample
What you also need to know: Like with gonorrhea, if you have had oral or anal sex, let your healthcare provider know this also. These sites may be infected, but vaginal or urine samples may not be positive
HIV
How the test is done: Blood test or swab from inside of mouth
What you also need to know: Confidential and anonymous testing options are available in many clinics
Genital herpes(no symptoms)
How the test is done: Blood test (drawn from arm or a fingerstick)
What you also need to know: Be sure to ask for a type-specific IgG test (not an IgM test)
Genital herpes (with symptoms)
How the test is done: Swab of affected area; if at first negative for herpes, follow later with blood test to make sure.
What you also need to know: Must be done as soon as possible; “viral culture” test not as accurate after 48 hours. A negative culture does not mean that you do not have genital herpes.
Syphilis
How the test is done: Blood test, or sample taken from a sore.
What you also need to know: The CDC recommends all pregnant women be tested for syphilis
Trichomoniasis
How the test is done: Swab of infected area, physical exam or sample of discharge.
What you also need to know: “Trich” is harder to detect in men than in women
HPV (genital warts)
How the test is done: Visual diagnosis
What you also need to know: Warts can occur in both men and women.
HPV (cervical cancer)
How the test is done: If Pap test result is abnormal, HPV DNA test and a biopsy may be done
What you also need to know: Pap tests detect cervical cell changes, not HPV. An abnormal test is often caused by HPV infection. No test available for men for these types of HPV.
What tests are recommended for you?
What should you get tested for? When? How often? Below are testing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While these guidelines are general ones, you are an individual. Your healthcare provider may have different recommendations based on your individual health status and history, of course.
Who should get tested for:
STDs/STIs in generalCDC guidelines don’t suggest routine STD/STI testing if you don’t have any symptoms. However, CDC does recommend routine testing for men who have sex with men. If you are entering a new relationship and are interested in general testing, know that not all doctors perform the same tests for STD/STIs. Learn which tests you need and which you might have to ask for.
ChlamydiaCDC recommends yearly chlamydia testing of all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors for chlamydial infections (those who have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners), and all pregnant women. Men should speak with their healthcare provider if they are at risk for chlamydia and if testing is recommended. Testing is a simple as peeing in a cup.
GonorrheaCDC recommends yearly gonorrhea screening for all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection.
HIVThe CDC recommends at least one HIV test for everyone aged 13 to 64 who visits a doctor. Most HIV is transmitted by the 25% of infected people who do not realize they are infected.
Cervical cancerPap tests, as a cervical cancer screening tool, are recommend for women beginning at age 21. Women age 30 and over are recommended to have an HPV test along with their Pap.
Breast cancerCDC recommends mammograms for women every one or two years starting at age 40.
Or another way to look at screening is . . .
What testing is recommended for . . .?
Women younger than 25 years oldCDC recommends yearly chlamydia and gonorrhea testing of all sexually active women younger than 25 years.
Women age 21 and olderPap tests, as a cervical cancer screening tool, are recommend for women beginning at age 21.
Men who have sex with menMen who have sex with men should talk to their healthcare providers about general STD/STI screening.
Everyone age 13 to 64The CDC recommends at least one HIV test for everyone aged 13 to 64 who visits a doctor. Most HIV is transmitted by the 25% of infected people who do not realize they are infected.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.
How do I sign up?

Search this websiteSexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance
It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

Search this websiteAre You Ready for Sex?
Sex, in its many different forms, can provide a way to express love, give and receive pleasure, and learn about yourself and the ways in which you communicate with other people. With that said, sex is also deeply personal, and can result in feeling vulnerable to another person. Your reaction to sexual expression is uniquely yours, and only you can determine, in any relationship, when you’re ready to have sex.
Even more importantly, no one ever has the right to pressure you into having sex. Consent should be freely, enthusiastically given.If you’re not ready–even if you and that person have had sex before–you always have the right to say no. It can be hard to say “no,” even if you want to; you might feel badly about hurting someone else’s feelings, or feel that there are expectations about what is supposed to happen. But, you are the only person who controls over your body.
Are you ready for sex?
The best way to prepare for the decision to have sex is to become comfortable with communicating about your needs. Consenting to one kind of sexual activity doesn’t automatically mean that you’re up for anything. The best way to make sure that your limits are understood and respected is to have sex with a partner who not only respects you and your body, but who will talk with you before you have sex about your concerns and boundaries.
Communicating these things before you’re actually in a sexual situation can be very helpful in making sure that you are both on the same page. If you don’t feel right about something, say so! Anyone who challenges your choices about whether or not to have sex is not giving you the respect that you deserve. Pay attention to your feelings, and don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for making decisions that are right for you.
Your Feelings Are Your Own
Because sex can bring about new feelings, it is helpful to think about your reactions, emotions and possible risks every time you consider having sex with a new person. Make sure you take time to think about how to prepare yourself for an experience that could be wonderful, but can also be hard emotionally. These questions can be helpful:
How will you feel about yourself after you have sex?
Why is it a good idea to have sex now, with this person?
How will you feel about your partner after you have sex?
Can you talk to that person about how you’re protecting yourself against pregnancy and STD/STIs?
If you’re new to sexual activity, have you spoken with someone you trust about how to find and use that protection (i.e. birth control methods, condoms, etc.) correctly?
Abstinence
Choosing abstinence, or making the decision not to have sex at all, is your option at any time. Even if you’ve had sex before, it’s still totally your right to decide that it’s not something that you want to do. You might choose not to have sex at all for a long time; you might decide not to do so after you’ve been sexually active for several years. Remember: it’s your body! Pay attention to your feelings, and give yourself time and space to make the best choice for you.
Asexuality/Aromantic
Asexuality is another thing that might come into play in your life. Being asexual means that you don’t feel sexual attraction to anyone. Remember that it is absolutely normal to experience phases in your life that don’t include sex or to decided that you aren’t interested in sex at all. However, if you want to learn more about your own feelings of asexuality or feel uncomfortable about them – especially if they come about abruptly – don’t hesitate to talk to a doctor or therapist.

Search this websiteHealth is Power
The Health Is Power toolkit is designed for organizations to better promote sexual health among young African American men (ages 18-30). The toolkit is designed mainly for heterosexual men, but also includes imagery and messaging that can be used with gay and bisexual men.
The creative concepts and messaging used with Health is Power were developed through a number of activities including formative research (literature review, expert panel meeting, and research with the target audience). A national survey done with more than 500 African American adults found the Health is Power concept connected strongly with heterosexual, gay, and bisexual men.
The objective of Health is Power is to promote positive sexual health behaviors through a multi-phased campaign with messaging around 1) increased condom use; 2) healthy relationships; 3) sexually transmitted disease prevention; and 4) open partner communication. Each phase of the campaign is designed to run between 2-4 week (although organizations should use the materials in a manner that best fits their needs).
Toolkit materials you can download include:
Customizable posters and postcards
Sample social media content, including Facebook posts, Tweets, images, cover images, and profile image
Web banners
Sample “Drop-in” website articles
The Increasing Importance of Social Media
According to the Pew Research Center (2014, 2015), African American adults are active on social media, with 67% of them on Facebook, 38% on Instagram, 28% on LinkedIn and 27% on Twitter. Youth (ages 18-29 years) are especially avid consumers of social media, with 87% on Facebook, 53% on Instagram, 37% on Twitter and 23% on LinkedIn.
Your agency can customize these materials with your own logo and by adding links to relevant information, resources, services or events your organization offers. We’re proud to support your good work in getting out the word that Health is Power!
Simply click here and fill in your organization name and email address to get instant access to the complete toolkit including customizable postcards, posters and banners.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.

Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.

Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.

CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.

Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.

Search this websiteSelf image
Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

Can someone be infected with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) from oral sex? Yes. Many STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, can be spread through oral sex. However, the chances of giving or getting STIs during oral sex can be lowered by using a condom or dental dam.
By definition, oral sex is when someone puts his or her lips, mouth or tongue on a man’s penis, a woman’s genitals (including the clitoris, vulva, and vaginal opening), or the anus of another person. There are different terms used to describe types of oral sex:
Fellatio is the technical term used to describe oral contact with the penis.
Cunnilingus describes oral contact with the clitoris, vulva or vaginal opening.
Anilingus (sometimes called “rimming”) refers to oral contact with the anus.
Oral sex is common among sexually active adults. According to a national survey conducted from June 2006 through December 2008, over 80% of sexually active youth and adults ages 15-44 years reported having had oral sex at least once with a partner of the opposite sex. The same survey found that 45% or more of teenage girls and boys (ages 15-19 years) report having had oral sex with a partner of the opposite sex.
As with other types of sexual activity, oral sex carries the risk of STIs. It may be possible to get some STIs in the mouth or throat from giving oral sex to a partner with a genital or anal/rectal infection, particularly from giving fellatio. It also may be possible to get certain STIs on the penis, and possibly the vagina, anus or rectum, from receiving oral sex from a partner with a mouth or throat infection. It’s possible to have an STI in more than one area, for example in the throat and the genitals.
STIs Transmitted Through Oral Sex
Chlamydia
Site of initial infection:
Throat
Genital Area
Urinary Tract
Rectum
Symptoms: Often there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they might include a sore throat, abnormal discharge from the vagina, penis, or rectum, and/or a burning feeling when urinating.
Treatment: Easily cured with antibiotic medicines.
Gonorrhea
Site of initial infection:
Throat
Genital Area
Urinary Tract
Rectum
Symptoms: Often there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they might include a sore throat, abnormal discharge from the vagina, penis, or rectum, and/or a burning feeling when urinating.
Treatment: Can be cured with antibiotic medicines, but drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea are increasing in many parts of the world, including the US.
Syphilis
Site of initial infection:
Mouth
Lips
Throat
Genital Area
Anus
Rectum
Symptoms: Often there are no symptoms. In the first or primary stage of infection, may have a single sore or multiple sores on mouth, throat, genitals, or anus. In the second stage, may have a skin rash (often on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, but also on other body parts). The symptoms of syphilis will disappear with or without treatment, but without treatment, the infection remains in the body and may cause organ damage.
Treatment: Curable with antibiotic medicines.
Herpes simplex virus (types 1 and 2)
Site of initial infection:
Lips
Mouth
Throat
Genital Area
Anus
Rectum
Buttocks
Symptoms: Often no noticeable symptoms. At times, blisters or sores are present on the mouth, lips, throat, genital area, anus, or buttocks.
Treatment: There is no cure for herpes, but medications can shorten and decrease or prevent outbreaks.
Human papillomavirus (HPV)
Site of initial infection:
Mouth
Throat
Genital Area
Anus
Rectum
Symptoms: Often there are no symptoms, although some types of HPV can cause genital warts—small bumps in and around the genitals and anus, or in the mouth or throat. Others types of HPV can develop into cancer of the mouth, throat, cervix, or rectum.
Treatment: There is no cure for HPV infection, but 90% of persons clear the infection within 2 years. Genital warts can be removed through different methods, including freezing. Appropriate follow-up and treatment for genital and rectal HPV infections (detected by abnormal Pap smear and/or HPV test results) is essential for cancer prevention and detection.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Site of initial infection:
Mouth
Genital Area
Anus
Rectum
Symptoms: Often there are no initial symptoms; however, after first being infected some people experience flu-like symptoms. HIV damages the body by destroying specific blood cells that help the body fight disease. HIV infection can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Treatment: There is no cure for HIV or AIDS, although anti-HIV medications can slow the progression of HIV infection and can help keep an HIV-infected person healthy.
Note: Certain things have been suggested to increase a person’s chances of getting HIV during oral sex, if exposed to an infected partner, such as having poor oral health, having bleeding gums or gum disease, having sores in the mouth or on the genitals, or being exposed to the “pre-cum” or “cum” (also known as pre-ejaculate or ejaculate) of an infected partner. However, no scientific studies have been done to show whether or not these factors actually do increase the risk of getting HIV or STI from oral sex.
Preventing STIs
The chances of giving or getting STIs during oral sex can be lowered by using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method each and every time a person has oral sex:
For fellatio (mouth-to-penis contact):
Cover the penis with a non-lubricated latex condom.
Use plastic (polyurethane) condoms, if a partner is allergic to latex.
For cunnilingus (mouth-to-vagina contact) and anilingus (mouth to anus contact):
Use a dental dam, or
Cut open a condom to make a square, and put it between the mouth and the partner’s vagina or anus.
The surest way to not get a sexually transmitted infection from oral sex is to abstain from vaginal, anal, and oral sex or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. However, many infected persons may be unaware of their infection because STIs often have no symptoms and are unrecognized.
Sexually active individuals should get tested regularly for STIs and HIV, and talk to all partner(s) about STIs. Anyone who thinks that he/she might have an STI should stop having sex and visit a doctor or clinic to get tested. There are free and low-cost options for testing available. It is important to talk openly with a health care provider about any activities that might put a person at risk for an STI, including oral sex.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

ASHA publishes Position Statements on emerging issues in health policy as part of its advocacy work. These statements are intended to reflect the perspective of Americans affected by sexually transmitted infections and outline the key reasoning and evidence behind ASHA’s recommendations.
Talking To Your Teens About STI PreventionWe don’t like talking with our youth about sex. Parents have difficulty talking with their adolescent children about sex. Schools often are constrained by societal pressures and funding sources to provide “abstinence only” messages rather than comprehensive sexual health information. In contrast, our entertainment media portrays human sexuality as spontaneous and idyllic, without complications of relationships or sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.
The truth is that sexually transmitted infections (also called sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) are an enormous problem in the United States, especially for adolescents and young adults. April is STD Awareness Month and a good time to talk about this uncomfortable but important issue.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections. The number of new cases of sexually transmitted infections is more than 9 million in people under the age of 25 each year.
Even worse, many of these are silent infections without clinical symptoms. Despite the absence of symptoms, long-term damage such as infertility can occur if infections are not diagnosed and treated. And many youth (and adults) assume that they would know if they or their partner had an infection.
The best way to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection is to be tested for it. Great strides have been made in recent years in development of reliable tests for many STIs using patient specimens that can be obtained easily.
Most youth assume they are being tested for “all” STIs when they go to their doctor. In fact, testing rarely occurs even for the more common infections, even though health care guidelines and medical associations recommend testing be done routinely.
Communication is an important issue in obtaining testing. Just as adults are reluctant to discuss sexual health issues with youth, youth are also reluctant to discuss this with adults, including health care providers. Young people need the necessary information to know what and how to ask for tests for STIs.
Testing, treatment and communication are all important in addressing the STI epidemic. But they are not sufficient. Knowledge and prevention are essential also.
Of great concern is the politicization of sexual health information, which makes it difficult to be certain about the accuracy and context of messages. Groups that attack the effectiveness of condoms for preventing STIs, for example, hope this will encourage abstinence. Instead, it leaves our young people at risk.
The simple fact is that condoms, used correctly and consistently, provide substantial protection against many STIs, including HIV infection. They do not protect against all STIs or under all circumstances, but for a person who chooses to be sexually active, using a condom is much better than not using one.
The stigma attached to many diseases such as cancer a generation ago has disappeared. But sexual behaviors and STIs remain highly stigmatized in our country. This stigma inhibits discussion with parents, partners, and health care providers and discourages youth from seeking needed health care. Stigma is a significant barrier to prevention. Social attitudes that reinforce this shame do not reduce frequency of sexual contact but they do reduce prevention behaviors and increase risk of infection.
It is biologically certain that our children will grow up and become sexually mature. STIs have been with humans for centuries. Information, education, supportive social environments, and sound, well-funded public health programs are effective at reducing risks of infection. Our failure to address these issues leaves our youth vulnerable. We as a nation need to review the lessons of the past and make effective control of STIs a high priority.

Worker Health and Safety in the Adult Film IndustryFor almost a century, the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) has sought to protect the sexual health of our nation. Since our inception in 1914, we have worked to inform policymakers, the public, health care providers and the press about the harmful consequences of unprotected and high-risk sexual activity. We have worked with policy makers to achieve sustained structural and institutional change to help Americans protect their sexual health.
Therefore, we are particularly concerned by the business practices and the current working conditions in the adult film industry and the lack of government oversight to protect workers. Workers are required in the course of their employment to engage in oral, vaginal and anal sex acts, often with multiple partners, within short periods of time, and without barrier protection. Workers may be regularly exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and the subsequent life-threatening and serious adverse reproductive health sequelae.
The very nature of the adult film industry exposes workers to great risk of infectious diseases. Abstinence, limiting the number of sex partners, condoms and education which are traditionally considered central to reducing the risk of STIs including HIV are not options available to workers in this industry. An HIV outbreak that occurred in 2004 demonstrates the serious health risk to workers in this industry. A performer who had tested regularly for HIV but who was working without condoms transmitted HIV to three others in the workplace.
It is essential that workers in the adult film industry use condoms and that those who produce adult films are held accountable, as are employers in any other industry, for maintaining a safe workplace that ensures the health and safety of those they employ. Just as personal protective equipment such as gloves for health care workers or goggles or masks are used to reduce the risk of injury or acquiring an infectious disease, condoms should be mandatory to protect workers in this industry.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for setting workplace standards and the enforcement of those standards. California OSHA has created standards specific to protecting adult film workers. Unfortunately, the standards have been ignored by the industry and enforcement is inadequate.
Increased regulation of the adult film industry has broad public health benefits that can not be overstated. Protecting workers from STIs also reduces harm to their families and limits spread to others in the community. Mandatory use of condoms, routine HIV and STI testing, and hepatitis and HPV vaccination would greatly enhance the health and safety of those who work in this industry.
This is not an inconsequential industry. It is estimated that the adult film industry earns an estimated $13 billion in gross revenues each year. It is appropriate and imperative that health and safety standards are applied and fully enforced to protect workers in this industry.
Over-the-Counter, Home-Use, Rapid HIV TestsThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) has been informing the public about, and advocating for, the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases since 1914. Since its inception, ASHA has strongly encouraged early diagnosis and treatment as a way to reduce further transmission in the community.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently estimates that about 250,000 – 300,000 people in the United States are infected yet unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Since HIV infection often takes a decade to develop into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), people living with HIV who remain undiagnosed risk spreading HIV without their knowledge for many years.
For two decades, ASHA has been an advocate of broader availability and use of HIV tests to facilitate more rapid diagnosis and treatment for those infected and to prevent further transmission in the community. Unfortunately, many people avoid or are unable to get tested in clinics or a physician’s office for a variety of reasons, including lack of access to health care services, distrust of the healthcare system, and the stigma of discovery.
We support CDC’s goals to implement new models for diagnosing HIV infection outside medical settings and to prevent new infections by working with persons diagnosed with HIV and their partners. A greater set of options, including over-the-counter, home-use, rapid HIV tests, may increase the number of people willing to be tested.
Clearly, it would be preferable for all individuals seeking HIV testing to receive pre- and post-test counseling in a supportive environment. However, the availability of these home-use tests could be a very powerful strategy to reduce barriers to testing and increase early detection of HIV infection.
It is imperative that those who test negative fully understand the implications of their test results, and those who test positive to have immediate access to counseling services and referral to quality medical care.
Comprehensive Sexual Health EducationThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) supports comprehensive health and sexuality education programs in the schools, from kindergarten through the 12th grade. The content of this education should include medically accurate and developmentally appropriate discussions of sexuality, reproduction, fertility, methods of contraception, decision-making, delaying first intercourse, abstinence, risk assessment and risk reduction, and sexually transmitted disease prevention, with special emphasis placed on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
ASHA urges states to adopt mandates requiring comprehensive, developmentally appropriate, and medically accurate sexuality education programs that:
are based on rigorous, peer reviewed published research;
show promise for delaying the onset of sexual activity and a reduction in sexual behavior that puts adolescents at risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, and for becoming pregnant;
include both factual information and skills building lessons related to reproductive biology, pregnancy, sexual transmission of diseases, sexual abstinence, sexual responsibility, communication, decision-making, and condom use;
include ample involvement of parents, health professionals, and other concerned community members in the development of the program;
include an ongoing evaluation component; and
are part of an overall health education program.
Male Latex Condoms as a Public Health InterventionThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) supports the promotion and use of male latex condoms as a public health prevention measure designed to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently.
The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is to abstain from sexual intercourse or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is not infected with any sexually transmitted infections.
For millions of people who have previously acquired a viral sexually transmitted infection, however, effective measures must be taken to protect any future partners from infection. In the United States, there are 50 million people estimated to be infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV), 20 million people estimated to be infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), and 850,000-950,000 people estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.
Non-viral STDs also remain important public health challenges. Two of these diseases, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are regularly among the leading reportable infectious diseases in the United States.
Many people engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for acquiring STDs. Sexually active people must have access to information and options to reduce their risk. The male latex condom effectively reduces the risk of STD transmission when used correctly and consistently.
Numerous studies have shown that latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, have been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.
Correct and consistent use of male latex condoms can reduce the risk of transmitting genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is covered and protected.
While the effect of male latex condoms in preventing transmission of human papillomavirus is not known, studies have shown that condom use has been associated with lower rates of cervical cancer in women, an HPV-associated disease.
Therefore, correct and consistent use of male latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of transmission for these infections.
Race, Ethnicity & Sexually Transmitted DiseasesAfrican American and Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) believes the STD epidemic in communities of color requires the development of effectively targeted national prevention strategies. Sexually transmitted diseases are fueled by poverty, lack of access to health care, distrust of health systems, inadequate resources, and myriad other social factors and inequities. The coexistence of STDs with other social problems, including unemployment, teenage pregnancy, drug use/distribution and violence often impedes attempts to provide services, particularly since these other problems are often perceived as more compelling than sexual health issues.
The complexity of this problem is exacerbated by our national discomfort in discussing both race and the stigma associated with STDs. Yet the data suggest action is needed: African American adolescents and young adults have STD rates that are more than 20 times higher than those in white adolescents.
Comprehensive chlamydia screening programs for women thus far show higher rates for minority women than for white women.
Non-white women are nearly three times as likely as white women to be hospitalized with acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and more than two times as likely to be hospitalized with chronic PID.
African American women are nearly three times more likely to die of cervical cancer than white women.
Reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis are about three times higher for Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites.
Recommendations:
Involve all racial/ethnic communities in STD prevention. including planning, developing, implementing and evaluating programs.
Develop culturally competent/sensitive and linguistically appropriate behavioral interventions for STD and HIV prevention in minority communities.
Integrate STD prevention with other relevant programs through which the affected population has been successfully reached.
Identify methods to overcome potential reporting bias, including increased and improved enforcement of mandatory reporting requirements by private providers to assist in alleviating reporting bias.
Raising and Supporting Sexually Healthy YouthWe live in a sexual world, from birth to death, and the messages children receive from parents, television and films, musicians, actors, politicians, peers, and advertisers shape their views about sexuality. American society appears at times to narrow its focus from the broad nature of human sexuality to a fixation on sexual intercourse. Further troubling is the negative light in which this focus continues to be shone. We need to have a broad definition of sexuality, encompassing the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors related to being female or male, being attracted and attractive to others, and being in love, as well as the broad implications of experiencing sexual intimacy and engaging in physical sexual activity.
The American Sexual Health Association, recognizing that all people are sexual beings from birth to death, asserts that all members of society have certain rights and consequent responsibilities:
Adolescents have rights to balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, access to confidential sexual health services, and a secure stake in the future. Respect and should be included in shaping programs and policies that affect their well-being.
Society has the responsibility to provide young people with the tools needed to safeguard their sexual health and protect them from unwanted and coerced sexual activity
Adolescents have the responsibility to protect themselves from bearing children too early and from acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
Collaborating with Faith-Based OrganizationsThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) recognizes and appreciates the strength, vision, and influence inherent in communities of faith. These communities are often central to the lives of their members, and therefore play a critical role in caring for the minds, bodies and spirits of their members and the larger community. Self-concept and concepts related to health and healing are often formed according to religious tradition and influence. For example:
In the area of childhood and adult immunization
Faith-based organizations and communities often serve as the primary caregivers of our nation’s youth as well as the elderly. Through pre-school, after-school and adult-care programs, they have a unique opportunity to ensure that families have access to information about vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as access to the vaccines themselves.
In the area of adolescent health
Faith-based organizations and communities have historically played a critical role in the socialization and development of their members. In an era where adolescents are increasingly more vulnerable to health-related threats and challenges, these organizations can play a critical role in educating their membership about the biological and social factors that place youth at greater risk than those in other age groups.
In the area of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Faith-based organizations and communities can be a powerful force in the prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, by creating an atmosphere which reduces the stigma surrounding these infections and encourages the acquisition of information and skills necessary to prevent their transmission.
Recommendations:
Public health officials should seek input from faith-based organizations when deciding health policy. Agencies responsible for public health should collaborate with faith-based organizations when conducting community needs assessments and implementing health education and prevention programs. Including clergy and representatives of faith-based organization on boards of directors, community planning initiatives and on governing bodies can be useful. Researchers should include faith-based organizations in efforts to promote and conduct health research.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Search this websiteUnderstanding Women’s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women’s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.
To get a better understanding of women’s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:
76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.
Only 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Not only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection
Most women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition
Women with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)
These survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women’s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and “Dos and Don’ts” for providers to share with their patients.
The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (“women with bacterial vaginosis”). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.

Our youth today are growing up in a culture that surrounds them with sexual imagery and messages—but one in which marriage is often delayed until the late twenties or later. Historically, public health prevention messages have singled out abstinence until marriage as the most effective way to remain free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yet while abstinence is a fundamentally important aspect of preventing STIs, but this message alone does not serve well in the absence of comprehensive sexual education and a supportive environment. ASHA believes young people deserve balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, as well as access to confidential sexual health services.
Comprehensive Sex Ed
Research clearly shows that comprehensive sex education programs do not encourage teens to start having sexual intercourse, do not increase the frequency with which teens have intercourse, and do not increase the number of a teen’s sexual partners. Research also shows that sex education programs that promote abstinence only have in fact proven ineffective.
Federal appropriations for abstinence-only education programs have exceeded $1 billion since 1982. However, reviews have found that none of the programs has shown a positive impact on sexual behavior or STDs over time. Furthermore, some research shows that young adults who made virginity pledges (to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage) as teens ultimately have rates of STIs similar to young adults who did not make such promises as teens and are less likely to use contraception or protection when they do become sexually active.
A position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine published in the Journal of Adolescent Health discussed two reviews that evaluated the evidence supporting abstinence-only programs and comprehensive sexuality education programs designed to promote abstinence. As the authors note, “Neither review found scientific evidence that abstinence-only programs demonstrate efficacy in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse. Likewise, research on adolescents taking virginity pledges suggest that failure rates for the pledge are very high, especially when biological outcomes such as STIs are considered. Although it has been suggested that abstinence-only education is 100% effective, these studies suggest that, in actual practice, efficacy may approach zero.”
If you are an educator who supports comprehensive sex education, we hope you find this site and our site for teens and young adults—iwannaknow.org-—useful resources for both you and your students. Both sites offer information on sexual health for teens and young adults, including comprehensive information on sexually transmitted infections, as well as information on healthy relationships, and more.
Our publications site — ashapublications.org —offers a variety of educational materials, including books, pamphlets, and novelty items. Our award-winning booklet, Be an Askable Parent, is a valued resource for parents wanting to establish and maintain open and honest communication with their child throughout all stages of his or her life.

Click below and choose the ASHA or NCCC program you would like to support.  Join our Sustainers Circle by signing up to make a monthly gift and you’ll receive a free USB drive filled with historical ASHA posters. Questions? Please call us at 800-552-4375.
Memorial and Tribute Donations
Make a gift in honor or in memory of someone special. This is a unique and wonderful way to acknowledge them. A letter will be sent to his or her family to inform them of your generous gift, though the amount of your contribution will remain confidential.
Endowment Fund
A gift toward ASHA’s endowment helps ensure that the American Sexual Health Association can provide services to the current as well as future generations. Donors can establish a named endowment with an investment of $10,000. This is a wonderful way to create your own legacy or to honor your family or a family member and ensure the continued excellence of ASHA’s programs and services.
Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form. The stock powers should be signed and the signature guaranteed by your local bank or broker. Mail the stock powers, along with a letter indicating your intent to make a gift, to the address below. Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.
How do I sign up?

It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,
Lynn Barclay

Experts say we can only meet sexual health challenges by shifting away from the current focus on diseases and moving towards a perspective that promotes health and wellness. In a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Viewpoint published online June 18, 2015, Sexual Health in America: Improving Patient Care and Public Health, former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, PhD, former ASHA Board Chair Edward W. Hook III, MD, and current ASHA Board member Eli Coleman, PhD, say we can move towards solutions by embracing a comprehensive sexual health framework that looks towards the promotion of health and wellness rather than a narrow fixation on diseases. Read the Viewpoint here.
While talking to patients about sexual health is important, it can be a difficult task. Many patients are uncomfortable asking questions or sharing concerns, and providers themselves often address the topic too quickly or not at all. As an illustration, 2012 national survey of U.S. OB-GYNs revealed that only 40 percent of those surveyed routinely ask questions to assess for sexual problems or dysfunction and only 29 percent routinely ask patients about satisfaction with their sexual lives. Fewer than a third—28 percent—routinely confirm a patient’s sexual orientation.
Part of the problem is starting the conversation. A 2009 poll of 304 US healthcare providers by the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP) and HealthyWomen found that 74 percent of providers rely on their patients to initiate a discussion about sexual health. A survey that same year by the Women’s Sexual Health Foundation found that approximately the same amount of patients—73 percent preferred—that the healthcare provider brings up the topic of sexual health.
Communicating with patients about their sexual health is an essential part of patient care. After all, sexual health is an important part of overall health and routinely addressing sexual health issues can help destigmatize the subject of sex and sexual behavior and help increase patients’ comfort level in seeking care.
Below are selected resources to help improve communication with patients around sexual health.
Developed by the National Association of Community Health Centers and the Fenway Institute’s National LGBT Health Education Center, the toolkit Taking Routine Histories of Sexual Health: A System-Wide Approach for Health Centers facilitates the taking of routine sexual health histories as part of primary care visits. Key components of the toolkit are available as Word documents so that they can easily be customized and branded for your organization.
“The Proactive Sexual Health History”: This article from American Family Physician discusses a routine way to elicit the patient’s sexual history that avoids judgmental attitudes and asks the patient for permission to discuss sexual function.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers A Guide to Taking a Sexual Health History, a printable 24-page booklet on discussing sexual health issues with patients, with a specific focus on sexually transmitted infections (STI). The guide includes sample dialogue to use to assess a patient’s risk for sexually transmitted infections.
The National Coalition for Sexual Health offers Sexual Health and Your Patients, a provider’s guide created to help primary care providers learn how to better incorporate sexual health discussions and recommended preventive sexual health services into an adult or adolescent wellness visit.
Talking to Young Patients about Sexual Health
This video from CDC looks discusses the importance of a healthy dialogue between providers and young patients concerning their sexual health and features CDC Epidemiologist, Elizabeth Torrone, Ph.D. MSPH.

Sexual relationships work best when everybody is clear about what they want. If you don’t tell your partner what you want, you might find you expect different things. One of you might be looking for a fling, and the other a marriage!
Many people confuse love, commitment, and sex, or assume the three always go hand-in-hand. There are many ways to express love, and you don’t need to have sex with someone to show them you love them. Having sex with someone also does not necessarily mean you are in love with them.
Having sex in a committed relationship can make people feel closer and more loving. Having sex in non-committed relationship can also be lots of fun and can make people feel like better friends. Whether you have a one night fling or a fifty-year marriage, it is very important that you like, respect and trust your partner and that you feel liked, respected and trusted by them, as well.
Types of relationships
When entering into a new relationship and throughout the course of a relationship (since our expectations often change over time!), talk about whether you want a relationship that is:
Committed or non-committed? Do you want a commitment such as marriage, long-term dating, raising children, sharing finances, and/or sharing a home, or do you want a less committed dating relationship?
Friendly or Romantic? Do you want a relationship that is based on friendship, or do you prefer a romantic, emotionally intimate relationship?
Sexual or non-sexual? Do you expect that you will want to have sex with this person? If you do, are there some sexual activities you want to do and others you do not?
Monogamous or non-monogamous? Do you want your relationship to be only with that person, so that you each have sex only with each other, or not, so that you and your partner have sex with other people?
Remember to explore each of those questions separately. All combinations are possible!
Common Relationship Structures
Asexual or non-sexual Asexual people do not generally have sexual feelings, and/or they choose not to have sex. People who identify as asexual may want emotional relationships, including long-term committed, loving, non-sexual partnerships.Others do have sexual feelings but do not want or do not feel ready for sexual activity with another person, so they are completely or selectively abstinent.
Lifetime mutual monogamyIn these relationships, each person has only one sexual partner in a lifetime. Both partners only have sex with each other.
Mutual serial monogamy This is a common relationship structure among many adults. When someone is serially monogamous, they may have sexual contact with more than one person over a lifetime, but they only maintain one long-term sexual partnership at a time, in which both partners are monogamous (have sex only with each other).
Mutual fidelity Mutual fidelity is similar to mutual monogamy except that there may be more than two people involved in this kind of relationship. Groups or families of three, four or more may have sexual relationships with one another but not have sex with anyone outside the group.
Sexually non-monogamous relationships Sexually non-monogamous relationships include consensual/honest non-monogamy such as “casual dating,” swinging, polyamory, and open relationships, as well as non-consensual/dishonest non-monogamy, also known as cheating. There are a wide variety of sexually non-monogamous relationship structures that people may choose, in which one or more members of a couple or group have sex with others.
Note: Though at first glance it may seem like a sexually non-monogamous person is at a higher risk of STI infection than a serially monogamous one, remember that relationship structure is only one risk factor for STIs. Other things that increase the chance of getting an STI are a high number of lifetime sexual partners, irregular STI testing and treatment, sharing needles for IV drug use, having sex with strangers or sex workers, and incorrect and/or irregular use of sexual barriers. A sexually non-monogamous person who correctly and regularly uses sexual barriers such as condoms may be less likely to get an STI than a mutually serially monogamous person who does not use barriers or has a partner of unknown STI status.

Search this websiteMenopause
Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

There are a number of risk factors for cancer; increasingly of interest to researchers is the link between cancer and viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Some sexually transmitted infections are among those that can increase the risk for developing certain cancers:
HPV is the primary cause of a number of cancers including those of the cervix, anus, and penis
Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections cause liver cancer
HIV patients are susceptible to several cancers including Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer targeting the lining of blood vessels
Most individuals with these infections won’t develop cancer but it’s a good idea to learn more about how to reduce your risk and take care of yourself. Both HPV and hepatitis B are preventable through vaccines, for example. Talk with your healthcare provider to see which vaccinations, tests and exams might be recommended for you.
The National Cancer Institute fact sheet is also a good resource to learn more about the link between infectious agents and cancer.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

There are many ways you can help support ASHA’s efforts and become involved in sexual and reproductive health advocacy.
Who are ASHA Ambassadors?
Are you passionate about sexual health? Do you have skills to share? Consider getting involved with ASHA. Our volunteer program runs in tandem with our Ambassador program – it allows you to be as involved as you want to be and connects you with our global network of supporters. ASHA ambassadors are sexual health advocates that use social media to share important information. Headquartered on SocialToaster, the ambassador program allows you to share information on a host of sexual health topics straight from your inbox.
If you have a special interest in cervical cancer, you may want to volunteer with a local chapter of our National Cervical Cancer Coalition, or start a chapter of your own.
If you have questions about STDs or want to talk with others, visit ASHA’s online support community or share you story with others here on our site.
Stay up to date on what’s going on at ASHA and in the world of sexual health by subscribing to ASHA’s e-newsletter.
Interested in local and national politics? Learn more about how you can make your voice heard by advocating for sound STI policy.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—The federal public health agency serving as the center for preventing, tracking, controlling and investigating the epidemiology of AIDS and other diseases.
Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

Around 38,000 people will contract HIV each year and 1 in 7 of those will not know they have been infected. We decided there’s a need to have a focused group of people working to share important HIV prevention, testing, and treatment messages. We are so excited to announce the launch of the HIV Ambassador Program!
Can I be an HIV Ambassador?
Yes you can! Anyone who wants to promote accurate, science-based information about HIV and its prevention can be an Ambassador!
How does it work?
HIV related content from ASHA will be sent to you each week from SocialToaster and you can share these posts to the account that you have linked. The posts will NOT share automatically. You have control of what you post and you must click “share” for the post to appear on your account. Feel free to create original content! HIV Ambassadors will receive one post each week with about 75% of those focused on HIV prevention, treatment, and addressing stigma. The other 25% will focus on broader sexual health topics such as healthy relationships, reproductive health, and other STIs.
How do I sign up?
Follow this link and create an account. Or sign up below! We are excited for you to join us!

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteFederal Funding for Teen Pregnancy Prevention Programs Abruptly Cut
July 19, 2017
Earlier this month, 81 organizations that currently receive funding from Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) were notified by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) this funding would end June 30, 2018. The notice came as a surprise, as these programs were awarded five-year grants in 2015—totaling $213.6 million—with an original end date of June 30, 2020.
As reported in Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting, several grantees were told by officials at the DHHS Office of Adolescent Health that the decision to eliminate funding came from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. It’s current head is recent Trump appointee Valerie Huber, who comes to the position from the National Abstinence Education Association (recently renamed Ascend) that has rebranded abstinence as “sexual risk avoidance” and promotes this as poverty reduction. As Martha Kempner writes at Rewire, “Teen parents are, in fact, more likely to live in poverty than their peers who have children at a later age. But suggesting that avoiding all sex until marriage will prevent you from being poor later in life is an extreme message not based in research.”
These preemptive funding cuts, which Reveal notes were done outside the traditional federal budget process, leave the future of these evidence-based program in question. Learn more at Reveal.

The most recent Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report, released by the CDC in October, revealed that 1,526,658 cases of chlamydia were reported in 2015—the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to CDC. But the reported rate does not necessarily reflect the total burden of chlamydia either; because the infection is asymptomatic in most people (about 7 out of 10), many cases are undiagnosed, despite the recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) calling for annual chlamydia for all sexually active adolescents and young women age 25 years and under.
The National Chlamydia Coalition has developed resources to help you learn more about how to integrate chlamydia screening into clinical practice and determine ways to address issues such as maintaining confidentiality for teen patients and taking a sexual history.
Screening for Chlamydia
Routine chlamydia screening is recommended for all sexually active adolescents and young women age 25 years and under. Women over age 25 with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, all pregnant women, and men who have sex with men, or are in high risk settings should also be screened. Chlamydia is easily detected from a swab or urine specimen and treated with antibiotics. Rescreening and treating sexual partners prevents re-infection. The National Commission on Prevention Priorities ranks chlamydia screening as a high value, but underused clinical preventive service. Chlamydia screening could reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by up to 60%. To view the most recent HEDIS screening data, click here.
Why Screen for Chlamydia? An Implementation Guide for Healthcare Providers covers the latest information and tools for healthcare providers to improve delivery of chlamydia screening to patients and make chlamydia screening and care a routine part of a medical practice, including ways to:
Improve the delivery of chlamydia screening and retesting
Make screening for and treating chlamydia routine practice
Provide confidential care to adolescents
Take a sexual history

Currently, male condoms are the only widely available, proven method for reducing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during intercourse. Organizations around the world recommend condom use for the prevention of pregnancy and HIV/STIs.
While not as widely available, female condoms also offer protection against unintended pregnancy and STIs. Female condoms offer women greater control over contraception and STI prevention.
ASHA supports the promotion and use of condoms to limit the spread of STIs and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently.
The surest way to avoid transmission of STIs is to abstain from sexual intercourse or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is not infected with any sexually transmitted infections. People who choose to be sexually active must have access to information and options to reduce their risk.
Male condoms: DOs and DON’Ts
CONDOM DOs:
DO use only latex or polyurethane (plastic) condoms.
DO keep condoms in a cool, dry place.
DO put the condom on an erect (hard) penis before there is any contact with a partner’s genitals.
DO use plenty of lubricant with latex condoms if you find vaginal sex is uncomfortable, or that condoms tend to rip or tear. Don’t use oil-based products with latex condoms (see DON’TS for more on this). Water-based lubes are condom-friendly but might increase the risks of STIs with anal sex. Consider using silicone-based lubricants for anal intercourse.
DO hold the condom in place at the base of the penis before withdrawing (pulling out) after sex.
DO throw the condom away after it’s been used.
CONDOM DON’Ts:
DON’T use out of date condoms. Check the expiration date carefully. Old condoms can be dry, brittle or weakened and can break more easily.
DON’T unroll the condom before putting it on the erect penis.
DON’T leave condoms in hot places like your wallet or in your car.
DON’T use oil-based products, like baby or cooking oils, hand lotion or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline®) as lubricants with latex condoms. The oil quickly weakens latex and can cause condoms to break.
DON’T use your fingernails or teeth when opening a condom wrapper. It’s very easy to tear the condom inside. If you do tear a condom while opening the wrapper, throw that condom away and get a new one.
DON’T reuse a condom. Always use a new condom for each kind of sex you have.
DON’T regularly use lubricants with spermicide called nonoxynol-9 (“N-9”) as they may cause skin irritation or tiny abrasions that make the genital skin more susceptible to STIs.

Search this websiteBirth Control Options
Birth control isn’t just a woman’s concern. While men have far fewer birth control options available than women, they do have options.
Abstinence: Abstinence (not having oral, anal or vaginal sex) is obviously a sure way to avoid not only pregnancy, but sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well. But while avoiding sex, partners can still engage in sex play like sexual massage, mutual masturbation, or other activities that don’t involve penetration. However, know that some STIs, such as genital herpes and HPV, can still be transmitted even if there is no penetration.
Condoms: Condoms* are not only highly effective at preventing pregnancy, but also protect against STIs as well. Of course, that is when they are used consistently and correctly. (Unsure how to use a condom correctly? Click here.) Even if a woman is using some form of birth control, the male partner can still use condoms to provide extra protection against unintended pregnancy (and STIs).
Vasectomy: Vasectomy is a surgical option of contraception that involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles) to prevent sperm from mixing with semen. While a vasectomy is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, it is also typically a permanent one. While it is possible to reconnect the vas deferens through surgery, the procedure is expensive, complicated and not guaranteed to work, so this is not the  best option for men who want the option of biological children in the future.
Withdrawl: While not a very effective method (about 1 in 5 who use withdrawl as birth control get pregnant), it is inexpensive and convenient. Withdrawl is just that–withdrawing or “pulling out” the penis before ejaculating. For withdrawl to be successful, a man must be aware and in control of his body and be able and willing to pull out in time. However, even if a man does withdraw before he ejaculates, there may be viable sperm in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum, fluid that comes of the penis before ejaculating) that can cause pregnancy.In addition to low effectiveness, withdrawl does not protect against STIs in any way.
For more resources on how to have safer sex visit this page.
While there are few birth control options for men available now, there may be more in the future. Researchers are currently looking at both hormonal methods involving preventing sperm production as well as non-permanent methods of blocking the vas deferens. But more research is needed to give men more viable options to share responsibility for pregnancy prevention.
*Male condoms are available in latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene, and lambskin. Lambskin condoms do not protect against STIs. If using latex condoms, use only water-based lubricants, not oil-based ones

Ambassadors are willing to start conversations about taboo topics and are passionate about creating a sexually healthy nation. They use social media as a platform for sharing important sexual health information. Want to see what ASHA ambassadors are doing? Check out the hashtag #ISpeakSexHealth across all Social Media Platforms!
If you want to play a vital role in creating a sexually healthy nation then ASHA’s Volunteer Ambassador Program is the place for you. Volunteering as an ambassador is super easy but is an extremely important component of ASHA. Twice a week, ASHA Ambassadors are sent content that they can choose to share onto their own social media platforms. This allows ASHA to expand our audience by getting sexual health information out into a variety of social networks that may otherwise never receive it! In addition, we periodically have other opportunities for people to get more involved in the work that ASHA is doing.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

One important prevention tool against sexually transmitted diseases and infections (STDs/STIs) is vaccination. Currently, vaccines are available to protect against infection with HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Other vaccines are under development, including those for HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV).
Hepatitis B
Who should get the hepatitis B vaccine?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis B vaccination for:
Sex partners of anyone who has hepatitis B
Anyone who is sexually active but not in a long-term, monogamous relationship
Those treated for STD/STIs
Men who have sex with men
Others recommended for hepatitis B vaccine include:
All infants and children under age 19 who have not had the vaccine
Injecting drug users who share needles
Those living in households with someone who has hepatitis B
Anyone whose work places them in contact with blood
Those with HIV or chronic liver disease
Individuals in correctional facilities
Travelers to areas with a high prevalence of hepatitis B
How it is given?
Three or four shots over six months.
Is it safe and effective?
The hepatitis B vaccine is safe, and the most commonly reported side effect is soreness at the injection site. Those completing the series have greater than 90% protection against hepatitis B.
Hepatitis A
Who should have it?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis A vaccination for:
All children
Men who have sex with men
Illegal drug users
Others recommended for hepatitis A vaccine:
Anyone traveling to an area with a high prevalence of hepatitis A
Those with hepatitis B or C
How is it given?
Two shots, six months apart. A hepatitis A/hepatitis B combination vaccine can also be given to adults. The combined vaccine is given in three doses over six months.
Is it safe and effective?
The hepatitis A vaccine is effective and provides long-term protection after the second dose. Soreness at the injection site is the most common side effect reported.
Human papilomavirus (HPV) vaccine
Who is it recommended for?
The CDC recommends all boys and girls get HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12. The vaccine produces a stronger immune response when taken during the preteen years. For this reason, up until age 14, only two doses are the vaccine are required. Young women and men can get the vaccine up to age 26, but for those 15 and older, a full three-dose series is needed.
On October 5, 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil-9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26.
How is it given?
If started before the 15th birthday, the recommended schedule is 2 doses, with the second dose given 6–12 months after the first dose (0, 6–12. For those starting after the 15th birthday, the second dose should be given 1–2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be given 6 months after the first dose.
Is it safe and effective?
Both the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say HPV vaccines are safe. The most commonly reported side effects include pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site. Some patients report fainting, so those receiving the vaccine are encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes before leaving the clinic or medical office.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.

We have a lot of relationships in our lives: family members, neighbors, friends, romantic partners and more. Romantic relationships are an important part of that. They can bring us companionship and intimacy.  But, while it’s important that dating partners care for each other, it’s just as important that you take care of yourself! In order to do this, we must be able to recognize when a relationship is healthy and when it is not.
In a healthy relationship, both partners:
Are treated with kindness and respect
Are honest with each other
Like to spend time together
Take an interest in things that are important to each other
Respect one another’s emotional, physical and sexual limits
Can speak honestly about their feelings
What does an unhealthy relationship look like? What about abuse? Follow this link to find out.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Search this websiteTrump Announces Ban on Transgender People in the Military [Updated]
July 26, 2017
In a series of Tweets posted this morning, President Trump announced that transgender individuals will no longer be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, citing “the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow……
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
….Transgender individuals to
serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming…..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
….victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
This abrupt announcement reversed a decision made in June 2016 that enabled transgender service members to serve openly. In a statement announcing that policy, then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated, “Our mission is to defend this country, and we don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who can best accomplish the mission.”
While the policy was to take effect on July 1, 2017, current Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delayed its implementation for six months to allow for a review of whether transgender service members would affect the “readiness or lethality” of the force.
The National Center for Transgender Equality estimates that over 134,000 American veterans are transgender, and over 15,000 transgender people are currently serving in military. Executive Director Mara Keisling offered the following statement today on Trump’s announcement:
“This is worse than don’t ask don’t tell, this is don’t serve, don’t serve. This is an appalling attack on our service members; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness, reason or science. It is indefensible and cannot stand. The President wants to discard thousands of trained and skilled troops who are already serving honorably and done nothing but be honest about who they are. To turn away qualified recruits simply because of who they are is a shameful way to show our country’s gratitude to the people who serve our country.”
Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, offered this statement on the ban:
“President Trump today issued a direct attack on transgender Americans, and his administration will stop at nothing to implement its anti-LGBTQ ideology within our government – even if it means denying some of our bravest Americans the right to serve and protect our nation. Today further exposed President Trump’s overall goal to erase LGBTQ Americans from this nation. Trump has never been a friend to LGBTQ Americans, and this action couldn’t make that any more clear.”
[UPDATED 7/27/17] In a letter to senior military leaders, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford wrote that there will be no immediate change to the current military policy on transgender individuals: “There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President’s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance.” He added that “we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.”
[UPDATED 8/25/17] On August 25, President Trump issued a directive to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security preventing transgender individuals from joining the military, making official the ban he initially announced via Twitter. The directive gives Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to determine whether active-duty service members can continue to serve, giving Mattis six months to develop a plan to implement the policy . Commenting on the directive, Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated “it would be a step in the wrong direction to force currently serving transgender individuals to leave the military solely on the basis of their gender identity rather than medical and readiness standards that should always be at the heart of Department of Defense personnel policy.” Lambda Legal, a national organization committed to achieving full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV, announced plans to bring a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the new policy.

Why I Vaccinate: Maria Trent, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advocates for creating an “HPV-free zone” through vaccination. Dr. Trent speaks to fellow healthcare providers about the importance of vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV).
Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
In 2018 updated cervical cancer screening guidelines were issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every five years with high-risk HPV testing (hrHPV) alone as an alternative to screening every three years with Pap testing alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. The guidance also includes a recommendation for hrHPV and Pap co-testing every five years for women in the same age group.
Cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21.
Most HPV infections acquired in teens and young adults clear up spontaneously, including those caused by high-risk types. It is now recognized that screening young women soon after onset of sexual activity results in large numbers of HPV infections and Pap test abnormalities that can safely be ignored, but that historically have resulted in unnecessary treatment accompanied by preventable anxiety and stress.
For women ages 20-29, screening with cytology alone every three years
For women 30 and over:
Screening every three years with cytology alone
Screening every five years with cytology/HPV co-testing
Screening every five years with HPV testing alone
For women 65 and over: Cervical cancer screening can end for most women at age 65, provided they have a history of adequate screening tests with normal results
Post-hysterectomy: Screening is not recommended for women of any age after removal of the cervix unless there is a history of significant cervical precancer (CIN2 or higher).

Search this websiteSexual Pleasure
Whether we’re attracted to the opposite gender, the same gender or both, the truth is: We learn how to experience sexual pleasure for pleasure’s sake by understanding our own sexual desires and responses.
Our enjoyment of specific sexual behaviors and practices varies from one individual to another. No matter what stimulates our individual sexual desires or which sexual practices we use to satisfy them, we are all sexual beings. How we choose to behave as sexual beings is up to us.
Health Benefits
Sex has been shown to promote better sleep habits, less stress, more happiness, etc. Sex is a healthy bodily function. Our bodies thrive on the chemicals released during orgasm, so a healthy sex life is indeed part of a healthy body.
How will you experience sexual pleasure?
There isn’t a “right way” to experience sexual pleasure. Start with that rich fantasy life you’ve written in your head. If you have a partner, he/she might enjoy it as much as you do! Talk about it with your partner. Understand that sexual pleasure is a matter of mutual interest. Remember that consenting adults can be as sexually adventurous as they please. And don’t forget that your partner is likely to have an entirely different set of favorite stimuli.
Communication is Key
Successful, long-term relationships are based on communication. Feeling safe from disease and trusting our partner is the foundation for comfortable, relaxed healthy sex. Safety, comfort and trust allow us to freely discuss our sexual needs and limitations with a partner. Be direct! Speak up!
“I like it when you touch…”
“I really enjoy…”
“Would you like me to…”
Open, frank communication with a partner is mandatory to giving and receiving sexual pleasure.
It’s About You
Everyone doesn’t have a partner. Not everyone wants a partner. Some people are between partners. The reality is: You don’t need a partner to enjoy great sex.
It’s okay–even healthy–to masturbate regularly. Orgasm not only relieves stress; it also boosts the immune system and burns calories! Indulge in whichever solitary sexual behaviors bring the most pleasure. It’s up to you to choose how or if you reach orgasm. There are no rules, no “right ways” to achieve sexual pleasure as long as there’s no danger to you or anyone else.
A satisfying sex life begins with an understanding of our own sexual needs and responsibilities. Ultimately, we are responsible for our own sexual pleasure. Then, we can acknowledge the needs and responsibilities of our partners.

Sexual Difficulties in Men
Sexual difficulties in middle age are just as natural to the aging process as a change in hearing, vision, or physical strength. While it’s important to understand why most men over 40 experience some form of sexual difficulty, it’s more important to understand that sexual difficulties in middle age (and beyond) can be managed.
Types of Sexual Difficulties
Ejaculation disorders
This includes premature ejaculation (the inability to delay ejaculation until it is mutually desirable by both partners), inhibited or delayed ejaculation (ejaculation that is slow to occur, or doesn’t happen at all) and retrograde ejaculation (ejaculate is forced back into the bladder rather than through the urethra and out the end of the penis at orgasm).
Premature ejaculation and Inhibited ejaculation Premature ejaculation s the most common of these problems, especially among younger men. There are techniques men can use to help delay ejaculation—and using condoms may help too (and, as a bonus, they help protect against STIs and unintended pregnancy). While medications can play a role in ejaculation problems, both premature and inhibited ejaculation may have a psychological cause, like anxiety about sex or sexual performance, or sexual trauma. A qualified therapist or counselor may be helpful in resolving the issue, if this is the case.
Retrograde ejaculation can be the result of side effects from medication, nerve damage, or surgery, such as prostate or bladder surgery. Depending on the cause, the treatment usually consists of changing an existing medication or prescribing a new medication. If surgery is the underlying cause, the condition may not be correctable. However treatment isn’t medically necessary—unless pregnancy is a goal. In that case, treatment would be needed to allow a man to ejaculate semen through the penis.
Loss of Libidio
A loss of libido, also called inhibited desire, is a decrease in desire for, or interest in, sexual activity. This can affect both men and women, and for some of the same reasons—stress, depression, side effects of medication, or relationship problems. But loss of sexual desire in men can also be the result of a decrease in testosterone levels, which is natural as men age.
Erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction, or ED, is the inability to achieve or sustain an erection suitable for sexual intercourse. While more common as men get older, ED is a medical condition that can affect men of any age. ED happens when there is not enough blood flow to the penis, preventing an erection. Causes are largely physical, but there can be psychological and lifestyle causes as well.
The majority of cases of ED have physical causes, often related to vascular diseases (related to blood flow) such as heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. It can also be caused by other types of physical conditions, like neurological problems (e.g. stroke or Parkinson’s disease), trauma to the pelvic area (including trauma from surgery, such as surgery related to prostate cancer), hormonal problems (e.g. thyroid disease) or chronic illnesses.
Sometimes there are psychological reasons behind ED. These might include depression, relationship problems, or a fear of intimacy. Lifestyle factors can also play a role, including drug abuse, alcoholism, smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Sometimes prescription drugs taken to treat a variety of conditions are the source of the problem (there are many prescription drugs that can cause ED.)
It is however, not uncommon to see ED in an otherwise completely healthy person, both physically and psychologically. Read more about ED here and check out our video on myths and facts about ED below.

The quality of your sex life affects your entire life. So, if you’re having a hard time enjoying or desiring sex it’s important to find out why. There are a number of reasons for this, such as culture, background, and past sexual experiences. Emotional, physical, and psychological factors can affect intimacy and sex, too. These can include:
Relationship problems
Depression, anxiety, and stress
Age-related changes
Hormone changes
Certain medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis
Medication side effects (for instance, from medicines used to treat depression, anxiety, and blood pressure)
Troubles with having sex or enjoying it are sometimes called female sexual dysfunction or female sexual difficulties (FSD). It can be life-long or can develop over time. FSD is defined as persistent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm, or pain that causes you distress or strains your relationship with your partner. While every woman deserves a fulfilling sex life, more than 40% of women will have sexual difficulties at some point in their lives.
There are four main types of FSD:
Low sexual desire. Lack of interest in sex and sexual activity.
Sexual arousal disorder. Difficulty in becoming aroused or lack of sexual response during sexual activity.
Orgasmic disorder. Consistent difficulty (or inability) to reach orgasm.
Sexual pain disorder. Pain during intercourse (called dyspareunia) or with vaginal stimulation.
Many women experience one or more of these problems at one point or another, from trouble reaching orgasm or just not feeling “in the mood.” But for some women, these problems are ongoing and can affect a woman’s sense of well being and relationships.
The good news is that these problems can be treated. While there’s no magic bullet promising a quick and easy cure, there are ways to deal with sexual difficulties. The first step is to look at the possible causes.
Causes
Physical/biological: There are a number of physicial conditions that can affect a woman’s sexual response and reduce pleasure and satisfaction. For example, conditions such as thyroid disease and diabetes can result in reduced vaginal lubrication which can make sex uncomfortable and less satisfying. Hormonal issues, such low estrogen levels, can also reduce lubrication and thin the vaginal lining, while lowered testosterone levels can lower the sex drive.
A decreased sex drive can also be the result of certain medications, including drugs to control blood pressure and some antidepressants, and can make it difficult for a woman to reach orgasm. Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or vaginitis can all make sex uncomfortable or even painful, as can vaginal infections, pelvic surgery or bowel difficulties.
Psychological/emotional: A woman’s sexual response involves not just the body but the mind, of course, and emotional factors play a role in sexual satisfaction. Anxiety, depression, and simply the stresses of everyday life can contribute to sexual problems, as can problems in a relationship. Issues with body image as well as religious and/or cultural factors can also contribute.
Listen to ASHA’s three-part conversation with sociologist and sexual health expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz on female sexual difficulties. She discusses the range of female sexual difficulties, the impact of sexual difficulties on a relationship, and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You can listen on ASHA’s website or via iTunes.
Sometimes the issues that lead to sexual problems are temporary – such as stress or medication use – and can be resolved easily. But when does the occasional difficulty become a real problem? If difficulties are ongoing and causing distress, then it may be time to seek help.
Finding Help
A healthcare provider can help you figure out what might be behind the difficulties you’re experiencing and find ways to resolve the problem. Your provider will likely ask you about:
your medical history
any medications or supplements you may take
your sexual history
current and past relationships
Depending on your symptoms and concerns, she or he may do a pelvic exam to look for signs of infection or irritation or perhaps a pelvic ultrasound to identify any anatomical issues. If psychological issues seem to be the principle cause of the problem, your provider may offer a referral to a counselor.
If your problem has a hormonal cause, such as low estrogen or a thyroid deficiency, the provider may suggest a medical treatment option. She or he might also suggest adjusting or changing your current medication whose side effects may be causing your symptoms. But there are also non-medical options that can help.
Communication: Talk to your partner about your concerns and problems you are having and what your needs are. A caring partner will be willing to work with you to find solutions.
Experiment: Sometimes trying something new can help. For example, if pain is an issue, try new positions to discover what might be more comfortable. To address a lack of arousal or trouble reaching orgasm, you might spend more time on foreplay, explore sensual massage, or experiment with vibrators or other sex toys to see what you find pleasurable. The Sinclair Institute is one resource that offers sexual health products for adults.
Lubrication: Vaginal dryness can make sex uncomfortable, even painful. While this can be a result of different problem and medications, is it also a common problem among post-menopausal women. Using lubricants can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable. For some women, local hormonal therapy, such as an estrogen cream, might be recommended by a provider.
Talk with a professional: A counselor or therapist who specializes in sexuality and sexual problems can help both you and your partner better understand your sexual problems and offer and strategies to improve intimacy. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) allows you to search for a sex therapist or counselor in your area.

There are many things you can do to reduce your risk of contracting an sexually transmitted disease or infection (STD/STI).
Abstinence
We hear often that “abstinence” is a fool-proof way to avoid the risks of sexual activity, but what exactly is abstinence? There are different definitions for abstinence. Here at ASHA, we believe that abstinence means you are not having any kind of sex with someone else. Someone who chooses abstinence may have sexual feelings but chooses not to have sex with others–no oral, vaginal or anal sex of any kind. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting an STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. You have a right to choose abstinence and any partner who doesn’t respect your wishes may not be the best partner for you.
Another type of abstinence sometimes discussed is selective abstinence. Many people are sexually active but limit what they do to avoid STD/STIs and/or pregnancy or because they do not feel ready to do some sexual things. Someone who chooses to be selectively abstinent might have some kinds of sex but not others. Someone who practices selective abstinence may or may not run the risk of contracting an STI and/or having an unwanted pregnancy, depending on the activities in which he or she does.
Mutual monogamy
Mutual monogamy (only having sex with your partner) is another way to limit exposure to STIs. If neither partner has ever had sexual contact of any kind with another person, there is no risk of STIs. If either person has ever had sex with anyone else, we recommend getting tested and, if necessary, treated for STIs at the beginning of each relationship. Know that many STIs can be “silent,” causing no noticeable symptoms in men or women. Also know that some STIs may not be detectable through testing for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, so talk to your healthcare provider about the appropriate time to get tested.
Communication
Talk with your partner(s) about STIs, sexual health, and prevention prior to sexual activity. Open communication fosters trust and respect among partners and is a key aspect of reducing the risks for STIs. Also, don’t be afraid to talk honestly with your healthcare provider about your sexual practices or to ask about STD/STI tests, including determining which STIs you’ve been tested for—and which you haven’t been.
Get Tested
The only way to know if you or your partner has an STI is to get tested. Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested before you start having sex.
Low-risk and high-risk activities
Low risk activities include open mouth kissing (French kissing) and hand-to-genital contact. Activities that are higher risk for STD/STIs include oral sex (genital or anal), vaginal intercourse and other genital-to-genital contact, anal intercourse and sharing sex toys with no barriers. Both vaginal intercourse and any contact between a penis and a vagina are high risk for pregnancy. A woman can become pregnant even if a man “pulls out” and does not ejaculate into her vagina.
Barriers
Barriers such as condoms can also reduce the risk of contracting a STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. Learn more about barriers and safer sex.
Avoid alcohol and recreational drug use
Avoiding alcohol and recreational drug use reduces the risk of contracting an STD/STI, having an unwanted pregnancy, or being coerced to have sex. Alcohol and drug use can reduce our ability to make good decisions and make it less likely that we will actually implement the safer sex decisions we had made previously. It may also make us more likely to be coerced into participating in an activity without being able to give our full and informed consent.

It’s exhausting to continue talking about this year after year, but here we are…again. This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published STD surveillance data for 2018 that show cases of reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis- are at record levels. Also we see a troubling trend where our most vulnerable populations – including newborns! -continue to be hardest hit.
The 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2018 represent a 14% increase over the previous year. It’s unfathomable to me that in 2018 there was also a 40% increase in congenital syphilis (when the infection is passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy). This is heartbreaking, cruel, and unacceptable.
Gonorrhea cases increased 5% to more than 580,000 reported cases and while the chlamydia incidence jumped by 3% to more than 1.7 million cases, experts think many cases are unreported and the true burden with chlamydia may be much higher. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently without symptoms (especially with females); without prompt treatment these infections can cause a number of complications including infertility. This is one reason why testing is so important, and why ASHA launched our Yes Means Test initiative to encourage STD testing among young people, especially young women.
What drives these numbers? Factors like incarceration, poverty, stigma, and homophobia all play a role. Add to that the fact that our STD control programs are constantly asked to do more with fewer resources.  As a nation, we have to face the reality we are choosing to tolerate STD rates at epidemic levels.
I ask you to please learn the facts, take a stand, and speak up. Get started with a visit to the advocacy page of ASHA’s website and consider becoming one of our sexual health ambassadors, too. If you have questions about STDs, visit our Ask the Experts forum for a wealth of insight.
Yours in good sexual health,

The issues are complex and not always easy to discuss but there is a strong need to ensure healthy dialogue on issues of sexuality, sexual health, and responsible sexual behaviors.  While much attention is focused on adolescents and adverse outcomes of sexual activity, it’s also important to create opportunities for sex positive discussion that goes beyond adolescents and young adults.
As journalists, you strive to provide the latest, most accurate information about sexual health to your readers, listeners, viewers and visitors.
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), founded in 1914, is the oldest national nonprofit with a central mission of addressing sexuality across a spectrum that recognizes the rich diversity of sexual functioning and expression in our society. This touches on a variety of issues including access to reproductive health care, the rights of sexual minorities, comprehensive sexual education for young people, consent and agency over one’s body, and the importance of sex, pleasure, and healthy relationships in our overall health and quality of life.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) also are an area of focus for ASHA, given there are nearly 20 million new cases of STIs every year in the United States, and experts believe the majority of sexually active individuals will have one or more STIs in their lifetimes (though many cases are never diagnosed or recognized).
In an effort to fulfill its commitment to better public health, ASHA reaches out with a variety of tools: hotlines, media campaigns, printed materials, community-based projects, support groups, research and advocacy efforts. ASHA provides up-to-date, factual information to more than 13,000 people every day.
We believe strongly that journalists play an important role in helping ASHA educate the public about STIs. By contacting ASHA, you can get background information on STIs or reach a content expert.
If you are a journalist in need of information not found on this site, please contact Media Relations or call 919.361.3124.
This section of the site is intended to help you best serve your audience. We appreciate your feedback to ensure that this section best addresses your questions and issues about sexual health and sexually transmitted infections.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.

Search this websiteNew CDC Data Show that STD Rates Continue to Rise
August 29, 2018
New data released today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal that STD rates continue to climb in the U.S., with nearly 2.3 million cases reported to CDC. The data on five year trends in reported STDs show that increases in STDs have continued for four consecutive years. From 2013-2017:
Syphilis cases nearly doubled
Gonorrhea cases increased by 67%
Chlamydia remained at record highs
As Gail Bolan, MD, Director of the Division of STD Prevention at CDC commented, “After decades of declining STDs, in recent years, we’ve been sliding backwards. In addition to these sharp increases, we’re also facing new challenges that we must address like the potential link between STD risk and drug use and the ongoing threat that gonorrhea will eventually wear down our last highly effective antibiotic.”
While striking, the data on reported STDs is only part of the story. Many cases go undiagnosed and untreated, and the consequences of untreated infections can be severe. While chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are curable with antibiotics, complications of untreated infection include infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth in infants, and increased HIV risk.
Also important to note is the fact that STDs impact some groups more than others. Men who have sex with men (MSM) made up almost 70 percent of primary and secondary syphilis, and young women 15-24 made up about 45 percent of the 1.7 million reported cases of chlamydia.
In a press briefing announcing the release of the new data, Bolan noted the importance of following CDC’s recommendations for screening. As she stated, “We recommend that all sexually active women less than the age of 25 go in and get checked for chlamydia and gonorrhea on an annual basis. We recommend that men who are having sex with men, go in and get checked at least annually for sexually transmitted diseases…We just need to get our providers doing sexual histories and doing the appropriate screening and we need to have clients who come in and access care to be asking, do I need to be – everyone needs to ask their doctor, should I be tested for STDs, I hear they’re going up. So, have that conversation.”
Learn more about screening for STDs and how to talk to your healthcare provider about your sexual health.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

By twelfth grade, 65% of high school students will have engaged in sexual intercourse, and one in five sexually active teens will have had four or more sexual partners. These numbers continue to rise after high school. Teenagers and young adults are a vulnerable population because they make decisions and act in ways that put them at greater risk for STIs.
Young people are more likely than any other age group to:
Have multiple sex partners
Engage in unprotected sex
Use drugs and alcohol at high rates
Engage in high risk behaviors while under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol
Estimating how many sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases occur among young people is not a simple or straightforward task. First, most STIs can be “silent,” causing no noticeable symptoms. These asymptomatic infections can be diagnosed only through testing. Unfortunately, routine screening programs are not widespread, and social stigma and lack of public awareness concerning STIs often inhibits frank discussion between healthcare providers and patients about STIs. Even from estimates, however, it is clear that young people bear a large portion of the STI burden.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
Half of all STIs occur in young people aged 15–24 (even though they make up only 27% of the sexually active population).
One in four new STI cases occur in teenagers.
Young people aged 15-24 account for 70% of all gonorrhea infections and 63% of chlamydia infections.
Young people aged 13-24 account for approximately one in every four new HIV infections in the United States.
ASHA’s publication, Teens and STIs: Real Questions, Honest Answers gives teens solid information on how you can get an STI, what to do if you think you have one, what treatment options are available, and how to prevent STIs.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

Search this websiteA New Gender Option in Oregon
July 7, 2017
As of July 1, Oregon residents will have three options for gender on state-issued IDs and driver’s licenses: M, F or X. The X offers an option for individuals who identify as non-binary, neither exclusively male or female. The decision by the state’s Transportation Commission makes Oregon the first state in the country to allow residents to identify as non-binary. The Oregonian reports that plans for the new option were first announced last summer and 83 public comments were submitted to the
Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles. Only 12 people opposed the change.
While Oregon may be the first state to recognize non-binary identity, California is not far behind. The Gender Recognition Act, or Senate Bill 179, would allow an individual to change their gender on a birth certificate or driver’s license to be female, male, or non-binary. The bill has been passed in the senate and now must make it through the General Assembly and the office of the governor.

The Herpes Testing Toolkit
Genital herpes is a common viral infection, but it can be easily misdiagnosed and is often underdiagnosed. Clinicians can best serve their patients by using the correct laboratory test to provide a clear diagnosis along with providing education, reassurance, appropriate antiviral therapy, and resources for additional information and emotional support as needed.
The Herpes Testing Toolkit offers providers summary of evidence-based information and expert opinion about testing and diagnosing genital herpes. This complex and dynamic topic is organized into modules to simplify decision-making, assist with test interpretation and education and counseling.
Q&A on Herpes Testing
With newer, sophisticated DNA tests complementing type-specific blood tests and viral culture, the array of herpes simplex virus diagnostic options is more complex than ever. In this expert Q&A, Leandro Mena, MD, MPH, and James B. Brock, MD, of the University of Mississippi Medical Center explain the best uses of the different tests for herpes that are available to diagnose patients with and without symptoms.
Conversations with Herpes Experts
In this series of videos, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, professor emeritus at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, and Kees Rietmeijer, MD, PhD, professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, discuss common questions about herpes, with a specific focus on herpes testing.
Understanding Herpes Testing
Handsfield and Rietmeijer explain the types of herpes tests available, what tests are preferred for those with or without symptoms, and what test to avoid.
Who Should Be Tested for Herpes?
Should more people be tested for herpes to know if they have it? Who should be tested? Handsfield and Rietmeijer discuss these questions.
Herpes and Pregnancy
If a woman with genital herpes has virus present in the birth canal during delivery, herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be spread to an infant, causing neonatal herpes, a serious and sometimes fatal condition. But neonatal herpes is rare, and there are steps a woman and her healthcare providers can take to reduce the risk. Handsfield and Rietmeijer lay out the concerns and discuss prevention steps.
Benefits of Herpes Testing
Are there public health benefits to offering herpes testing to more patients? Handsfield and Rietmeijer look at the possibilities while discussing the increased risk of acquiring HIV and herpes in pregnancy.

Search this websiteSexual Functioning
An important part of overall sexual health is healthy sexual functioning—being able to experience sexual pleasure and satisfaction when desired.
Sexual pleasure can be experienced in many ways, from solo masturbation to oral sex to sensual massage to a range of other possibilities. When we are sexually exited, our bodies respond in certain ways. A racing heart, rapid breathing, a rush of blood to the genitals. For women, the vagina will become more lubricated and the clitoris will swell. For men, the increased blood flow leads to an erection. This is all part of the sexual response cycle.
But what happens when something in this response cycle doesn’t work as expected? Maybe a woman has trouble getting aroused or finds her body producing less lubrication, making intercourse painful. A man might have trouble getting or maintaining an erection, or may have difficulty reaching orgasm.
Sexual problems like these are not uncommon, and can have either psychological or physical causes. Health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure or other chronic illnesses can affect your sexual functioning, as can hormonal changes. The emotional effect of a chronic condition can impact sexual health too. Stress, anxiety or depression may even cause sexual difficulties in men and women. Medications to treat these conditions can also add to the problem.
But when does the occasional problem become a more serious one? When sexual difficulties are more than occasional, when they are persistent and upsetting and interfere with a healthy sex life, it is time to talk to a healthcare professional. The good news about sexual difficulties is that there are solutions. Sometimes, medication might be the answer. In other cases, therapy may be the right approach. What is important is to find the help you need to have a satisfying sex life.

Talking to a Partner
When there are sexual difficulties in a relationship, both parters are affected. For example, erectile dysfucntion (ED) isn’t just a man’s problem—his partner is affected as well. ED can cause a man to withdraw from sex and his partner. A female partner may blame herself, thinking that she is no longer desirable. She may also blame her partner and suspect infidelity as the cause behind his ED. A lack of communication can be destructive for couples dealing with ED. For men in relationships dealing with ED, talking with a partner is an essential part of managing the condition.

Search this websiteErectile Dysfunction
While erectile dysfunction (ED) is common, it’s also frequently misunderstood. Perhaps that’s because ED is a subject that is not often talked about—it can be awkward and embarrassing for both and men and women to discuss, even with a healthcare provider. But talking about it, and learning about it, can help men and their partners understand and manage this common condition.
What ED is:
The inability to maintain an erection suitable for intercourse.
A medical condition that can affect men of any age.
A common sexual problem that typically has a physical cause, but can also be the result of psychological issues or a side effect of medication.
Often, the first sign of an underlying medical condition.
What ED isn’t:
A “natural part of aging.”
A sign that a man isn’t interested in sex or isn’t attracted to his partner.
Something that only happens to older men.
Just a man’s problem.
A problem without solutions.
This last point is an important one to remember—there are solutions. The first step to that solution is talking to a healthcare provider to figure out what is causing ED. There are many things that can cause ED:
Heart disease
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Parkinson’s disease
Trauma from surgery, such as surgery related to prostate cancer
Hormonal problems (e.g. thyroid disease)
Anxiety
Depression
Relationship problems
Fear of intimacy or performance anxiety
Drug abuse
Alcoholism
Smoking
Obesity
Certain prescription medications
A healthcare provider can help figure out what is causing ED, and what treatment might be best.
Myths and Facts about ED
Involving Your Partner
ED isn’t just a man’s problem—his partner is affected as well. ED can cause a man to withdraw from sex and his partner. A female partner may blame herself, thinking that she is no longer desirable. She may also blame her partner and suspect infidelity as the cause behind his ED. A lack of communication can be destructive for couples dealing with ED. For men in relationships dealing with ED, talking with a partner is an essential part of managing the condition.
So how do couples start the conversation about ED?
What to do:
Acknowledge that this is difficult to talk about. For many men, sexual performance is a real part of self identity, and problems in that area can be a blow to a man’s self esteem. Recognize that this is hard to talk about, even embarrassing, but important—for both of you.
Educate yourselves about ED. Learn what ED is (and isn’t) to better understand what might be causing the problem. As most cases of ED have physical causes, focus on this as a medical problem like any other.
Stay positive and focus on solutions. There are many treatment options available and professionals, including healthcare providers and therapists, who can help.
What not to do:
Withdraw from your partner and avoid sex. This can only lead to greater misunderstanding of the issue.
Discuss this in the bedroom. Instead, choose a neutral place to talk and approach the subject in a calm manner, away from the heightened emotions of the bedroom.
(For partners) Internalize the problem. This is a medical problem your partner is dealing with. ED is does not mean your partner is cheating or no longer finds you attractive. Focus on helping your partner and encouraging him to seek medical help.
Treatment Options
There are a number of options to treat ED, depending on the cause. And since ED can often be the first sign of an underlying medical condition, discovering and treating this may help resolve the issues with ED as well as improve overall health.
Oral medicationThis is perhaps the most well known treatment for ED, but not necessarily well understood. ED drugs have helped many men with erection difficulties, but they aren’t magic pills that rev up the sex drive, give men instant “super” erections and make them better lovers. What these prescription drugs do is increase blood flow to the penis—a man still needs to be sexually aroused to achieve an erection. They don’t affect libido or give a man without ED a “better” erection, so they aren’t meant to be used as recreational drugs to improve the sexual experience.
There are several FDA-approved oral treatments for ED, all of which work in largely the same way. These drugs do have side effects and may not work for every man. They are also not recommended for men taking certain medications, including some to treat high blood pressure and chest pain, as the combination of such drugs can be dangerous. A healthcare provider should review all of a man’s medications before deciding whether oral medication is a safe option.
And oral medications—prescribed by a qualified provider—are a safe and effective option. ED drugs and “alternative” treatments sold online with no prescription needed are not.
Mechanical devicesFor some men, a vacuum constriction device may be the best alternative. As the name suggests, the device is used to create a vacuum to stimulate an erection. The penis is placed in to pump (a tube, or cylinder). Air is manually pumped up, stimulating blood flow to the penis, which helps bring on an erection. To maintain the erection, the man will place a ring around the base of the penis. While success rates with this device vary, research showed that more than 90% of men can experience functional erection with a vacuum constriction device with adequate practice. But as with oral medications, this therapy is not right for all men.
Hormone replacementLow testosterone is not a common cause of ED, but in these rare cases, testosterone therapy may be recommended. A man with testosterone deficiency will have symptoms other than ED, such as depression, a decreased interested in sex, and difficulty concentrating. Testosterone therapy can be given in different forms—including injections and patches—each of which has advantages and disadvantages. If hormone replacement is recommended by a healthcare provider, he or she will discuss which might be best.
Keeping ED in Perspective
An erection isn’t necessary for sexual satisfaction (or orgasm, for that matter). When managing ED, remember that there are many ways to please a partner and experience sexual pleasure. This can be an opportunity to expand your sexual boundaries as a couple and explore new practices, positions, and techniques. Keep the focus on pleasure, not an erection.

Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.

Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.

Contraceptive Choices
There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
Choosing the Right Contraceptives For You and Your Teen
There are several contraceptive options available today and it can be pretty overwhelming trying to decide. This episode of the Sex+Health Podcast talks about how to make the right choice and how to have conversations with your teens about using contraceptives. Lynn Barclay, ASHA’s CEO and President, talks with ASHA staff, Susan Reynolds, and her mother, Lisa Gardner, about having open and honest conversations about preventing pregnancy and STIs.
How can I protect my fertility?
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
How can STI’s affect your reproductive health?
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

There’s lots of misinformation out there about sex, sexual health and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Maybe you’ve heard something you are unsure about (like, can you really get an STI from a toilet seat?) If you want to know if something you’ve heard is true or false, write to us and we may post your question (and our answer) here. While we can’t personally respond to every e-mail we receive, we’ll address some of those here. Click on each statement learn the facts about STIs.
STIs
You can't get herpes from a toilet seat. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is spread by direct skin to skin contact. So unless you and another person are sharing a toilet seat at the same time, the toilet is not likely the source of the infection. Authors of the ASHA publication Managing Herpes, Living and Loving with HSV, Charles Ebel and Anna Wald, MD, say that transmission from a toilet seat falls along the line of “generally impossible.” So while you might want to check to see if the seat is clean and dry before sitting, you can leave worries about herpes behind.
You can get HIV from getting a tattoo or body piercing.There can be a risk for HIV or another blood-borne infection (like hepatitis B or C) if the instruments used for piercing or tattooing either are not sterilized or disinfected between clients. Any instrument used to pierce or cut the skin should be used once and thrown away. Ask the staff at the parlor about their equipment. They should show you what precautions they use, or don’t get pierced or tattooed there.
A Pap test is not an STD test.Pap tests are not specific tests for any sexually transmitted disease or infection (STD/STI). While some women think (or assume) that they are being tested for STDs/STIs when they have a Pap test, this is not the case. Talk to your healthcare provider about STD/STI testing and see if she or he recommends any tests for you.
You can't get HIV from a mosquito bite.HIV is not transmitted by mosquitoes. Studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and elsewhere have shown no evidence of HIV transmission from mosquitoes or any other insects—even in areas where there are many cases of AIDS and large populations of mosquitoes.
You can get an STI just through oral sex.During oral sex, you can give your partner your STI and you can get theirs. Not all STIs are transmitted through oral sex, but some are. For example, if your partner has a cold sore (oral herpes) and performs oral sex on you, you could become infected with herpes in your genital area.
Condoms
Baby oil and Vaseline® are not okay to use with latex condoms.Oil-based lubricants (like baby oil, Vaseline®, handcreams, Crisco) can break down latex and allow STDs/STIs to pass through. Instead, water soluble lubricants like K-Y Jelly®, Glide®, Aqualube®, most contraceptive jellies, saliva, or even plain ol’ water are good lubricants to use with condoms.
You can't use a condom more than once.A condom should NEVER be used more than once under any circumstances.
Sex and sexuality
Most women won't have an orgasm through vaginal sex only. Only about 30% of women reach orgasm through vaginal sex only. The other 70% need more manual or oral stimulation to achieve orgasms.
The average penis size is about 5 to 6 inches.According to the Kinsey Institute, the average erect (hard) penis length of U.S. males is between 5 to 6 inches, and average flaccid (not erect, or soft) penis length ranges between 1 and 4 inches.
Anal sex is not an activity just for gay men.Anal sex is a sexual act that many people enjoy, both gay and straight, men and women. This activity has nothing to do with sexual orientation.

Search this websiteSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.

Search this websiteSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.

Search this websiteWho We Are
ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.
ASHA Milestones

Search this websiteBirth Control Options
Birth control isn’t just a woman’s concern. While men have far fewer birth control options available than women, they do have options.
Abstinence: Abstinence (not having oral, anal or vaginal sex) is obviously a sure way to avoid not only pregnancy, but sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well. But while avoiding sex, partners can still engage in sex play like sexual massage, mutual masturbation, or other activities that don’t involve penetration. However, know that some STIs, such as genital herpes and HPV, can still be transmitted even if there is no penetration.
Condoms: Condoms* are not only highly effective at preventing pregnancy, but also protect against STIs as well. Of course, that is when they are used consistently and correctly. (Unsure how to use a condom correctly? Click here.) Even if a woman is using some form of birth control, the male partner can still use condoms to provide extra protection against unintended pregnancy (and STIs).
Vasectomy: Vasectomy is a surgical option of contraception that involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles) to prevent sperm from mixing with semen. While a vasectomy is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, it is also typically a permanent one. While it is possible to reconnect the vas deferens through surgery, the procedure is expensive, complicated and not guaranteed to work, so this is not the  best option for men who want the option of biological children in the future.
Withdrawl: While not a very effective method (about 1 in 5 who use withdrawl as birth control get pregnant), it is inexpensive and convenient. Withdrawl is just that–withdrawing or “pulling out” the penis before ejaculating. For withdrawl to be successful, a man must be aware and in control of his body and be able and willing to pull out in time. However, even if a man does withdraw before he ejaculates, there may be viable sperm in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum, fluid that comes of the penis before ejaculating) that can cause pregnancy.In addition to low effectiveness, withdrawl does not protect against STIs in any way.
For more resources on how to have safer sex visit this page.
While there are few birth control options for men available now, there may be more in the future. Researchers are currently looking at both hormonal methods involving preventing sperm production as well as non-permanent methods of blocking the vas deferens. But more research is needed to give men more viable options to share responsibility for pregnancy prevention.
*Male condoms are available in latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene, and lambskin. Lambskin condoms do not protect against STIs. If using latex condoms, use only water-based lubricants, not oil-based ones

Search this websiteWomen and STIs
While both men and women in the U.S. are diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in about equal numbers, they are not affected by STIs equally. For example, women are more likely than men to experience long-term health complications from untreated STIs, including infertility (the inability to have a baby). A pregnant woman can also pass an STI along to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth.
Why do STI’s have a greater impact on women?
Anatomy: A woman’s anatomy alone makes her more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections than a man. Unlike the relatively thick skin of the penis, a woman’s vagina is covered by a thin, more delicate mucous membrane that more easily allows viruses and bacteria to pass through—and cause infection. The vagina is also a warm and moist environment, the type of environment that encourages bacteria to grow.
Lack of symptoms: Women are less likely than men to have symptoms of some common STIs, like chlamydia and gonorrhea, and as a result, they are less likely to seek care and get treatment. When STIs are untreated, they can cause serious, lifelong health problems (see more below). Even when women do have symptoms, they may not recognize these as symptoms of an STI. After all, vaginal discharge can be normal and not a sign of infection, and itching and irritation can be the result of a yeast infection or even a new type of laundry detergent. Symptoms are never a reliable way to know if someone has an STI, and since women so often have no symptoms at all, regular testing is important for sexually active women (and men).
Long-term health complications: This is yet another area where women face more problems than men. STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea, if unnoticed and untreated, can lead to the condition Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) in women. PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that develops in the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus and is life threatening to the mother), and infertility (the inability to become pregnant or carry a child).
Infection with high-risk HPV can also cause serious consequences for women if undetected and untreated. High-risk HPV can cause changes in the cervix that can lead to cervical cancer if untreated. The good news, however, is that cervical cancer is preventable with regular screening and vaccination.
Problems during pregnancy: STIs pose a number of serious risks to a pregnant woman’s unborn child, from low birth weight, brain damage, blindness, deafness, and even stillbirth (death of the child). STIs can pass from the mother to the baby during pregnancy and during delivery. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant women be tested on their first prenatal visit for STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B. While there is a risk that women with herpes and HIV can pass their infection on to the baby, there are steps they can take to greatly reduce this risk. Strategies to reduce HIV transmission are particularly effective and have reduced the mother-to-child transmission rate in the United States and Europe to less than 1%.

A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—The federal public health agency serving as the center for preventing, tracking, controlling and investigating the epidemiology of AIDS and other diseases.
Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

Search this websiteMore than “Revenge”: Nonconsensual Porn
July 7, 2017
The term “revenge porn” made headlines in celebrity news this week, after Rob Kardashian posted explicit photos of ex-girlfriend Blac Chyna on his Instagram account, which was subsequently suspended. In California, where Kardashian lives, it is a crime for a person to distribute intimate, sexually explicit images “when he/she knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause serious emotional distress, and the person depicted suffers that distress,” and legal experts weighed in on HuffPo on the possible consequences of his actions. Whatever the motives in this case, the term “revenge porn” can be misleading, as individuals may post or share sexuality explicit photos for different reasons. The broader term “nonconsensual porn” better expresses what’s at issue here—explicit images are shared without an individual’s consent.
The problem is not uncommon. A 2016 report from the Data & Society Research Institute found that about 10.4 million people in the U.S. “have been threatened with or experienced the posting of explicit images without their consent.” Both men and women can be victims of nonconsensual porn, but the majority of nonconsensual images are of women—including service women. Earlier this year it was revealed that nude photos of more than two dozen female service members, active duty and veterans, were being shared by marines in a private Facebook group. While the marines involved may face charges under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, civilians can face legal consequences for sharing images without consent. According to the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, 38 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws against nonconsensual porn. The organization offers more information about nonconsensual porn and state laws here.

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending hepatitis C testing for everyone born from 1945 – 1965. While anyone can get Hepatitis C, Baby Boomers are five times more likely to be infected. CDC’s Know More Hepatitis campaign addresses this issue head on. The goal of this national, theory-driven multi-media education campaign is to ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with Hepatitis C by increasing testing among baby boomers so those who are infected can get linked to life-saving care.
According to the CDC, the reason for the high rates of hepatitis C in this age group is not completely understood. Most boomers are believed to have become infected in the 1970s and 1980s when rates of hepatitis C were the highest. Since people with hepatitis C can live for decades without symptoms, many boomers are unknowingly living with an infection they got many years ago.
The only way for someone to know if they are infected with hepatitis C is to get tested. For this reason, CDC encourages hepatitis C screening for everyone born between 1945-1965. The Know More Hepatitis campaign website has a range of material you can share with your patients that explain the risk to patients and promote the importance of testing.
Download a range of patient education materials—fact sheets, posters, and more—from the campaign pages at CDC.

Search this websiteTalking about Sex
“Imagine going to a restaurant where the chef served you whatever he or she felt like fixing instead of giving you a choice. Imagine a gardener who never asked, ‘How do you like your bushes trimmed?’ Yet when it comes to sex many of us assume that we know what our partner wants, or we clam up instead of giving feedback.”
— Paul Joannides, Psy.D., The Guide to Getting It On (6th ed.)
It is perfectly okay to keep some things private, especially fantasies that you enjoy on your own and do not care to share with someone else. But in any relationship, whether for one night or many years, there are things about which you do need to communicate. Talking about sex openly makes for relationships that are more fun and satisfying.
You can’t expect a partner to know what you like unless you tell them. People sometimes think that if their partner really loved them or cared about them the other person would do exactly what they wanted. But none of us is a mind reader! No two people want the same things, have the same fantasies, or want to be touched in the same ways.
Remember that whether you feel physical pleasure in response to something a partner does is not an indicator of their “skill” as a lover. What a previous partner liked may not be what gets you off, since each of us is different.
What is there to talk about?
Type of relationship that you want: Committed or non-committed? Friendly or romantic? Sexual or non-sexual? Monogamous or non-monogamous?
STI status: When were you last tested for STIs, and what were the results? Which STIs were you tested for? Not tested for? How many sexual partners have you had since your last round of testing? What were the STI statuses of those partners? What is your history of STI infection?
Tip: If you have been diagnosed with an STI, you will need to share this information with potential partners. The more positive, honest, and straight-forward you can be, the more positively your partner will hear you. Having an STI does not mean the end of a good sex life, but if you feel ashamed of your STI your partner will likely pick up on this. Gather as much factual information as you can about both your STI(s), including transmission, prevention, treatment, and the actual physical effects of the infection. Allow them to ask you questions, and do your best to answer them all honestly and without getting defensive. Remember that this is new news to your partner, and it may take him or her some time to adjust. It’s a great idea to have a pamphlet or book from ASHA’s library to give them to read, as well.
Birth control: Are you currently using birth control? Are you open to the possibility of pregnancy? What birth control precautions do you want to use?
“Safer Sex” precautions: What barriers do you want to use? What kind of sexual activities are you willing to enjoy without barriers?
Sexual pleasure: What kind of touch feels good to you? Where are the places that you especially enjoy being touched? How do you want to be touched, caressed, kissed, and/or held? The more you explore and know your own body through masturbation, the clearer you can be about what kind of touch you enjoy.
Tip: One way to communicate what you enjoy is by showing your partner how you like to touch yourself. Masturbating in front of a partner is both hot and informative! If your partner can watch the way you stroke your penis/rub your clitoris or use a sex toy, he or she can touch you in similar ways.
Sexual desires: What are sexual activities you know you like and want to do? Ones you have never done but think you might like to try? Ones you might be willing to try? Do you have fantasies you would like to talk about, role play (pretend to act out), or act out?
Sexual boundaries: What are the sexual activities or fantasies you are not willing to explore? Are there places on your body that you do not want to be touched?
Tip:Make a Yes-No-Maybe chart: Off by yourself, make a list of the things you like to do (Yes!), are not open to trying or don’t want to try again (No!), and things you might like to consider doing (Maybe!). Then get together and share your lists. You might both find some happy surprises!
But . . . how do I start the conversation? Keep reading to learn more.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a number of preventive care health services are now available for women without cost sharing–in other words, without co-payments, co-insurance, and deductibles. Millions of women now have access to important preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.
Among the preventive services covered include: (from hrsa.gov)
Cervical cancer: Screening for sexually active women.
HPV DNA testing: Women who are 30 or older have access to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing every three years, regardless of Pap smear results. Early screening, detection, and treatment have been shown to help reduce the prevalence of cervical cancer.
Well-woman visits: Regular sexual and reproductive health check-ups for women under 65.
STI counseling: Sexually-active women have access to annual counseling on sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These sessions have been shown to reduce risky behavior in patients, yet only 28 percent of women aged 18-44 years reported that they had discussed STIs with a doctor or nurse.
HIV screening and counseling: Sexually active women have access to annual counseling on HIV. Women are at increased risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. From 1999 to 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 15% increase in AIDS cases among women, and a 1% increase among men.
Chlamydia: Screening for younger women and other women at higher risk. CDC recommends yearly chlamydia testing of all sexually active women age 25 or younger, as well as older women with risk factors for chlamydia like those who have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners.
Gonorrhea: Screening for all women at higher risk.
Hepatitis B: Screening for pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.
Contraception and contraceptive counseling: Women with reproductive capacity have access to all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling, as prescribed by a healthcare provider. These recommendations do not include abortifacient drugs—drugs that induce an abortion. Contraception has additional health benefits like reduced risk of cancer and improving the health of mothers-to-be.
Interpersonal and domestic violence screening and counseling: Screening and counseling for interpersonal and domestic violence will be covered for all young and adult women. An estimated 25% of women in the United States report being targets of intimate partner violence during their lifetimes. Screening is effective in the early detection and effectiveness of interventions to increase the safety of abused women.
Learn more about women’s preventive health services in this discussion between HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Annic Jobin, WebMD’s Director of News and Partnerships.

A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.

Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.

Crabs (also known as pubic lice) are small parasites that feed on human blood. Crabs are usually found on the pubic hair, but can also be found on other parts of the body where a person has coarse hair (such as armpits, eyelashes, and facial hair). Crabs rarely infest head hair.
Anyone can get crabs. Having crabs does not mean a person is unclean or dirty. The most noticeable symptom of crabs is itching. The itching usually starts about 5 days after a person gets crabs.
There are several treatments for crabs. Some treatments require a prescription, while others do not. The only way to prevent infestation with crabs is avoid contact with infested people, bed linens, clothing, and furniture
FAQs
What are crabs?Crabs, or pubic lice, is an infestation of crab-like parasites that attach themselves to pubic hair and other course hair on the body. While the scientific name for the parasite is Pthirus pubis and the scientific name for the condition is Pediculus Pubis, both are referred to as crabs. Although crabs come from the same family of parasites as head and body lice, they are not the same thing. While crabs need blood to survive, they can live up to 24 hours off a human body.
Crabs have three very distinct phases:
The first phase is the egg, or nit.
The second phase is the nymph, or immature form of the adult.
The third phase is the louse, or adult crab.
How common is it?In the United States, there are an estimated 3 million cases of crabs every year.
How is it transmitted?Sexual Transmission: Most cases of crabs are transmitted through sexual contact, when the crabs move from the pubic hair of one person to the pubic hair of another. Even when there is no sexual penetration, you can get crabs or transmit crabs to someone else. You can get crabs whenever some part of your body that has coarse hair (such as the pubic area, eyelashes, eyebrows, facial hair, chest, or armpits) comes into contact with the infested pubic or other course hair. Crabs do not usually attach to head hair.
Nonsexual Transmission: Nonsexual transmission of crabs is also possible. A person can get crabs from:
sleeping in an infested bed or using infested towels.
wearing infested clothing.
an infested toilet seat, though this is rare.
What are the symptoms?
The most common symptom of crabs is itching in the pubic area. This itching is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites, and usually starts about five days after a person gets crabs.
A person may be able to see individual crabs by looking closely or using a magnifying glass. Crabs are small parasites that resemble crabs you see on the beach. They may be whitish-gray or rust colored.
A person may also notice crab eggs, or nits, attached to the base of the hair (close to where it comes out of your body). Nits are small, oval-shaped and pearl-like in color.
Dark or bluish spots can appear and last for several days in the infested area; these are also a result of the bites.
Crabs are usually found in the pubic area. However, crabs can also be found in the armpits, eyelashes, beard/mustache and other course hair. Sometimes, though rarely, crabs are found in the hair on a person’s head.
How are crabs diagnosed?You can usually see the crabs yourself if you look closely enough. You might need a magnifying glass to help you identify them. If you are uncertain, have a health care provider examine you. He or she may need to use a microscope.
How are crabs treated?Recommended treatments include:
Permethrin cream
The cream can be applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes.
Permethrin is available over the counter.
Should not be used for treatment of eyelashes or eyebrows.
Lindane shampoo (Kwell®)
A shampoo that is applied to the affected area and thoroughly washed off after 4 minutes.
Available only by prescription.
Should not be used for treatment of eyelashes or eyebrows.
Should not be used on broken skin.
Not recommended to be used by the following people:
women who are pregnant or lactating
children under 2 years of age
people with seizure disorders
people with extensive dermatitis or known allergies to any ingredients found in Lindane
NOTE: Lindane (Kwell®) is potentially harmful and may cause central nervous system complications, even though no problems have been known to occur in treatments limited to the recommended 4-minute period.
Pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide
This shampoo is applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes.
Available over the counter.
Should not be used for treatment of eyelashes or eyebrows.
For infested eyelids and eyebrows an ointment is available by prescription.
Even if treatment for crabs is successful, you may still have some itching as a result of a skin irritation or allergic reaction. If so, you can use hydrocortisone cream to help stop the itching.
What else can I do to get rid of crabs?
Even after treatment, most nits or eggs will remain attached to the hair. Nits can be removed with fingernails or a fine-tooth comb.
Wear clean clothing and sleep between freshly laundered bed linens after treatment.
Notify sex partners so that they can be treated.
Abstain from sex until treatment is successful and all partners have been treated.
After you are treated, your clothes and bedding may still be infested with crabs. To get rid of them, you will want to wash all your clothes, bed linens, sleeping bags, etc. in hot water (at least 130-degrees F). Dry on hot cycle for at least 20 minutes.
Items that cannot be washed can be placed in a plastic bag for two weeks or dry-cleaned to ensure decontamination.
It is not necessary to decontaminate furniture or fumigate living areas. If desired, furniture can be vacuumed or treated with a bug spray containing an agent active against crabs.
If after about a week you still see lice, do the treatment again. Make sure that all bedding and clothing have been washed and dried on a hot cycle, dry-cleaned or decontaminated in a plastic bag for two weeks. Also make sure that that sex partners have been treated.
Contact your healthcare provider if treatment still does not work.
What does it mean for my health?Crabs, in general, does not cause anything more than discomfort and inconvenience. Occasionally, secondary bacterial infections may occur due to aggressive scratching.
How can I reduce my risk?
As with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) there are things people can do to reduce or eliminate the risk of infection with chancroid. These include the following:
Abstinence(not having sex) is a sure way to avoid infection.
Mutual monogamy with an uninfected partner (having sex with only one partner who only has sex with you) is another way of reducing risk. Limiting the number of sex partners can also reduce risk as it would for all STIs.
Although latex condoms do not provide effective protection against crabs, condom use is effective in preventing other STIs.
How do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard. If you find out you have crabs, it is important that you talk to your partner as soon as you can so she or he can get treatment. It is possible to pass crabs back and forth. If you get treated and your partner doesn’t, you may get infected again.

There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.
You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.

Search this websiteSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and Females
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.

Search this websiteDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer Diagnosis
Hoping to lessen stigma and spur conversations between patients and health care professionals, Desperate Housewives actor Marcia Cross recently told CBS This Morning she was diagnosed with anal cancer about a year and a half ago.
“High risk” types of HPV are associated with a number of cancers beyond cervical and include cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat. During the interview Ms. Cross revealed her husband battled throat cancer several years ago and her doctor believes their diagnoses are likely related.
When asked in the CBS This Morning interview why she’s speaking out she said “I know that there are people that are ashamed. You have cancer! Do you then have also to feel ashamed like you did something bad, you know, because it took up residence in your anus? Come on, really, there’s enough on your plate.”
Beyond addressing the shame and reluctance that keeps us from talking about anal diseases, Cross said she’s speaking out to encourage parents to have their kids vaccinated against HPV. As for her own daughters she says “My girls don’t know it but they’re up for their first shot at the end of the school year!”

ASHA was founded in 1914 in New York City, formed out of early 20th century social reform movements focused on fighting sexually transmitted infections (known then as venereal disease, or VD) and prostitution. Now, more than 100 years after its creation, ASHA remains America’s nonprofit authority for sexual health information.
Our mission
The American Sexual Health Association promotes the sexual health of individuals, families and communities by advocating sound policies and practices and educating the public, professionals and policy makers, in order to foster healthy sexual behaviors and relationships and prevent adverse health outcomes.
Our Vision and Values
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) envisions a world where sexual and reproductive health and rights are universally recognized, and where comprehensive sexual health information and services are accessible and available to all, free from coercion, violence, and discrimination across the lifespan.
ASHA believes that all people have the right to the information and services that will help them to have optimum sexual health. We envision a time when stigma is no longer associated with sexual health and our nation is united in its belief that sexuality is a normal, healthy, and positive aspect of human life.
ASHA’s History
Read about ASHA’s early history in this article from Linnea Anderson, archivist at the Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota. The essay is published in Creating a Sexually Healthy Nation.
ASHA is America’s authority for sexual health information. We are an award-winning and trusted 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has advocated on behalf of those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since 1914.
ASHA was founded as the American Social Hygiene Association in 1914 by a group of public health reformers committed to attacking an undesirable social condition–venereal disease, or VD–that they believed could be improved through medical and educational means. The shame and reluctance to talk about sexuality was now weakened enough so that the public was at least generally aware of the dangers posed by VD. This was the first social marketing effort to mix physical and moral fitness for prevention of VD.
An early ASHA supporter was Thomas N. Hepburn, M.D., who joined after attending to a young woman who had died of acute gonorrheal peritonitis just months after her marriage to a man whose friends had put him to bed with a prostitute at his bachelor party. Additional founders include Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus, Harvard University, Jane Addams, Hull House, Chicago, Martha P. Falconer, a pioneering social worker, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and William F. Snow, M.D., Stanford University professor.
ASHA Milestones

1945: Boxer Joe Louis joins ASHA for a major public awareness campaign.
1954: ASHA begins to monitor rates of venereal disease by collecting data that was then analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “Today’s VD Control Problem” published by ASHA until 1975. ASHA testifies before Congress, as it continues to do today, to urge adequate federal appropriations for VD control.
1959: ASHA changes its name to the American Social Health Association.
1970s: Dramatic rise in sexually transmitted infection rates because of international travel, the sexual revolution, gay liberation and increasing drug use. Scientists recognizing more and more sexually transmitted pathogens. Genital herpes, human Papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B identified.

One important prevention tool against sexually transmitted diseases and infections (STDs/STIs) is vaccination. Currently, vaccines are available to protect against infection with HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Other vaccines are under development, including those for HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV).
Hepatitis B
Who should get the hepatitis B vaccine?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis B vaccination for:
Sex partners of anyone who has hepatitis B
Anyone who is sexually active but not in a long-term, monogamous relationship
Those treated for STD/STIs
Men who have sex with men
Others recommended for hepatitis B vaccine include:
All infants and children under age 19 who have not had the vaccine
Injecting drug users who share needles
Those living in households with someone who has hepatitis B
Anyone whose work places them in contact with blood
Those with HIV or chronic liver disease
Individuals in correctional facilities
Travelers to areas with a high prevalence of hepatitis B
How it is given?
Three or four shots over six months.
Is it safe and effective?
The hepatitis B vaccine is safe, and the most commonly reported side effect is soreness at the injection site. Those completing the series have greater than 90% protection against hepatitis B.
Hepatitis A
Who should have it?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis A vaccination for:
All children
Men who have sex with men
Illegal drug users
Others recommended for hepatitis A vaccine:
Anyone traveling to an area with a high prevalence of hepatitis A
Those with hepatitis B or C
How is it given?
Two shots, six months apart. A hepatitis A/hepatitis B combination vaccine can also be given to adults. The combined vaccine is given in three doses over six months.
Is it safe and effective?
The hepatitis A vaccine is effective and provides long-term protection after the second dose. Soreness at the injection site is the most common side effect reported.
Human papilomavirus (HPV) vaccine
Who is it recommended for?
The CDC recommends all boys and girls get HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12. The vaccine produces a stronger immune response when taken during the preteen years. For this reason, up until age 14, only two doses are the vaccine are required. Young women and men can get the vaccine up to age 26, but for those 15 and older, a full three-dose series is needed.
On October 5, 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil-9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26.
How is it given?
If started before the 15th birthday, the recommended schedule is 2 doses, with the second dose given 6–12 months after the first dose (0, 6–12. For those starting after the 15th birthday, the second dose should be given 1–2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be given 6 months after the first dose.
Is it safe and effective?
Both the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say HPV vaccines are safe. The most commonly reported side effects include pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site. Some patients report fainting, so those receiving the vaccine are encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes before leaving the clinic or medical office.

Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.

Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.

Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.

Below are stories we have received from educators and young people, discussing the value of comprehensive sex ed and the challenges they’ve faced. Have an opinion or story you’d like to share? Send it to us.
“Kids need to be taught…”
“I’m 14 years old and my parents have been pretty good about talking to me about sex. When I was young, I would ask my mom questions about things I saw on TV, or heard, and she would always answer. I think it bothers her now because she wants to know how I know a word or something, but she is still willing to answer.
“In school, it’s different. We had our mandatory sex ed in 9th grade and they taught about STIs and how you caught them, but the teachers refused to answer any questions about anything else, so everyone sat there confused. It was pretty frustrating.
“Most of the kids in my grade don’t know anything about safe sex, but I know lots of kids have had sex. In fact one of my friends is now pregnant. I know from talking to my friends and being at their houses, their parents aren’t like mine. They don’t talk about sex at all. I seriously think the schools should be teaching us about sex because a lot of kids don’t have this information and need to be taught.”
—Jennifer M., age 14
“I believe it is our duty to give students accurate sexual health knowledge…”
“Children need guidance and structure to become productive individuals in society. We as educators must give them those tools and hope they use them to better themselves and others. Unfortunately there are gaps within the education system that need to be filled. We see this most often with the sexual health curricula being taught to students in high school and younger.
“There are several types of sexual education programs, however there are three that most school systems use. They consist of abstinence-only based programs; abstinence plus, or comprehensive sex education programs. Abstinence-only programs focus exclusively on postponing sex until marriage. STIs and HIV are mentioned as a result of sexual activity, but condoms and birth control are not mentioned at all. Abstinence plus programs teaches that students should wait until marriage to have sex, but this type also refers to other methods of protection from STIs and HIV. The program that we feel is the most fitting to school aged children is a comprehensive sex education program. This program explains how to prevent pregnancy and STIs and explains the consequences of sexual decision-making, including information on types STIs.
“I feel that comprehensive programs encourage students to make smart decisions pertaining to sex rather then encourage them to do it in the first place. Making the decision to have sex will happen independently of the knowledge a child has. We would rather them be informed to be able to make a responsible decision. Not to say that abstinence is a bad thing. In fact its one of the most responsible choices a person could ever make. However we realize that not all students are going to choose that or choose to stay abstinent until married. I believe it is our duty to give students accurate sexual health knowledge whether or not they decide to have sex.
“I believe the answer is to present a more holistic program. The program should focus on not only prevention of negative sexual outcomes but overall sexual health and a comprehensive program is the only one that encompasses it all.”
—F.J., Minneapolis, MN

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

Search this websiteLast Abortion Clinic in Kentucky in Court Fight to Stay Open
September 8, 2017
A federal court case that got underway this week will determine whether or not the last remaining abortion clinic in the state of Kentucky will be forced to close. The EMW Women’s Surgical Center has been under threat of closure since March, when state regulators planned to revoke the clinic’s license, stating that the clinic’s agreements with a hospital and ambulance service contained technical deficiencies. At that time, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and attorneys at the Louisville firm Lynch, Cox, Gilman & Goodman P.S.C. filed a federal lawsuit to prevent the closure of the clinic.
The ACLU notes that the law that Kentucky is using to attempt to shut down the clinic is very similar to Texas laws that the Supreme Court recently struck down in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. As stated in the decision on that case: “Two provisions in a Texas law – requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and requiring abortion clinics in the state to have facilities comparable to an ambulatory surgical center – place a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion, constitute an undue burden on abortion access, and therefore violate the Constitution.”
The administration of Kentucky governor Matt Blevin shut down another EMW clinic in Lexington last year and sued a Planned Parenthood in Louisville, ultimately denying that facility a license to perform abortions. With the EMW Women’s Surgical Center now the state’s only option for women seeking an abortion, Kentucky joins six other states—North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Mississippi, Wyoming and West Virginia—with just one abortion clinic left.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reported rates of primary and secondary syphilis in 2015 were the highest in more than 20 years. While gay and bisexual men face the greatest burden, during 2014-2015 syphilis rates increased in every region, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity. Syphilis has increased among women in recent year, and the rate of reported congenital syphilis has increased each year during 2012–2015.
In response to these rising syphilis rates, CDC recently released the CDC Call to Action: Let’s Work Together to Stem the Tide of Rising Syphilis in the United States. This resource offers action steps for healthcare providers, public health departments and more, with specific steps healthcare providers can take to reduce congenital syphilis and syphilis among men who have sex with men.
The One-Two Punch: Knocking Out HIV and Syphilis Co-infection initiative offers downloads of a video and a collection of posters and social media content to encourage individuals to talk with health care professionals about testing for both infections. Click here for free access to all campaign materials.
The video below from CDC walks healthcare providers through the three key actions that they can take to help reverse the rising syphilis rates: Talk, Test, and Treat.

Featured Question
Earlier this year I was vaccinated against HPV. Are there other STI vaccines I should have?
Kudos for getting your HPV vaccination! That’s a smart and safe way to greatly reduce your risk. Some types of HPV can cause different types of cancer, including cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and anus. (Some other HPV types, not linked with cancer, cause genital warts.) HPV is very common; most sexually active people have at least one HPV infection in their lifetimes so vaccination is recommended for all teen and young adult males and females, and may be used through age 26.
Hepatitis B is another infection transmitted mainly through sexual contact for which a highly effective vaccine is available. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. There are about 19,000 new hepatitis B infections in the U.S. each year. Hepatitis B begins as an acute infection, meaning it’s often a short-term illness from which people recover.
In some cases, hepatitis B remains in the body and becomes a long-term or chronic infection. The younger a person is when he/she contracts hepatitis B the more likely he/she to develop a chronic infection.
Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through direct contact with fluids such as blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. In addition to sex (the most common route of infection in adults), hepatitis B can be transmitted through sharing needles, razors, or even toothbrushes with someone who’s infected. Infants can also contract the virus during childbirth if their mother is infected.
Hepatitis B is not spread through sharing cups and utensils, or through hugging, shaking hands, or breastfeeding.
The hepatitis B vaccine gives great protection against the virus. The vaccine is given in a series of 3-4 injections over six months and is fine for anyone who desires protection against hepatitis B. The vaccine is specifically recommended for:
Infants and children under age 19
Men who have sex with men
Sexual partners of those with hepatitis B
Injecting drug users who share needles, syringes, or other equipment
Healthcare workers
Travelers to areas where hepatitis B is common
Patients with chronic liver disease
For someone who hasn’t been vaccinated and has a recent exposure to someone with acute hepatitis B, an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) might keep them from becoming ill. This shot can provide protection for up to three months.
There’s also a vaccine for hepatitis A. Hepatitis A affects the liver, too, but unlike hepatitis A isn’t known to cause chronic issues and is seldom dangerous. Hepatitis A is spread through oral contact with feces, usually through contaminated food or water supplies. Hepatitis A is less often transmitted sexually, primarily through oral-anal contact (called rimming). CDC recommends hepatitis A vaccination for all children, men who have sex with men, and anyone using illegal drugs. Those traveling to areas with high rates of hepatitis A are also urged to be vaccinated.

I suffer from a stigma, not a disease.
I have had HSV-1 since I was a kid and HSV-2 since I was 19. I am 40 now. After all these years, I have this to share with anyone who’s been newly diagnosed with genital herpes: Do not be ashamed of yourself for having on your genitals what most people have on their mouths! It just doesn’t make sense. Most people have this virus on their mouths, and yet we don’t shame them, make them self-disclose before each kiss, think they are dirty, or get scared of kissing them between outbreaks!
If I had a magic wand I would get rid of herpes stigma. I would do this even before I’d use the magic wand to create a herpes cure. This infection rarely cause me any trouble. I’ve had flea bites that hurt worse than an outbreak. What I suffer from is people’s judgement and ignorance. And I’ve been very lucky — in 20 years of having this virus, few people have rejected me, and were polite when they did. I’ve heard terrible horror stories about the kind of rejection others have gotten. And it’s simply not fair, not logical, and doesn’t follow medical facts.
I used to get angry by the rejection. It’s a very small risk at an infection that causes mild symptoms! But what they really risk is catching something that stigmatizes them. They don’t want to catch the stigma. No one wants to suffer from the stigma, and it’s the stigma we need to fight.
Don’t be ashamed! You’re still as good and worthy and beautiful as you were before.
I was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999 . . .I’m a gay man who was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1999. Fortunately I only experienced a short-term (or acute) infection and am fine. Hepatitis B can be really serious, though, and I know I’m fortunate. Each and every gay man should have the hepatitis B vaccine. I wish I had gotten it when I was younger. Learn from me, and get your hep B shots! Take an HIV test. Use condoms. Don’t depend just on what the medical community says to do, take control and do something!
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old.
I found out I had HPV when I was 25 years old. At first the doctors told me it was nothing to worry about, that it would probably go away on its own. I had no idea at the time what type of HPV I had nor did I know that some types of the virus are linked to cervical cancer. No one told me! I had normal Paps for 3 years after that and it did not seem like a big deal until at 28 I was diagnosed with CIN-3 [significant cervical pre-cancer] and had a LEEP. That freaked me out big time. I went through all the common feelings of guilt and shame. I told potential sexual partners about HPV and I did not have one guy freak out on me. They were all really cool about it. It helps that since men don’t have a cervix, there really is no real fear of cancer–the incidence of HPV-related penile cancer is extremely low.
At the end of the day, I don’t know who gave me HPV and I don’t really care anymore. What I do know is that in some ways HPV has been a very positive thing in my life. Having HPV taught me how to speak up and be honest, how to take care of myself better (stress is an aggravating factor) and most of all, to become my own advocate. To all of you out there struggling with this diagnosis, know that you are not alone. Millions of people have HPV, even if they don’t talk about it. You are not damaged or defective in any way. You are perfect just as you are. Take some deep breaths and know that everything is going to be OK!
My HPV diagnosis
I went for my routine yearly check up but this time I went to a different gynecologist thinking that it will be just another boring consultation where they just make me uncomfortable. Dr. Watson started explaining what HPV is and how many women die of cervical cancer, she also said that she only uses the liquid Pap test as it is more accurate than the conventional Pap test. With the innovation of the liquid pap test, 100 percent of the sample is sent to the lab. This means technicians have more cells to make a determination from and have a clearer sample to look at. Lab technicians who read these slides say the difference is like night and day between the traditional Pap and the new liquid technology. I just heard “blah-blah-blah” and couldn’t wait to leave. Dr. Watson looked at me and with a very strict voice said, “Women are not educated enough about these things and think ‘It can’t happen to me.'” This is when I though, “Well I’m very healthy so it cannot happen to me.” I went home waiting for the little piece of paper to arrive in the post saying “normal” but instead Dr. Watson phoned me a week later to make an appointment for a biopsy as there were pre-cancerous cells detected caused by HPV.
Suddenly everything stopped. My busy day at work did not matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore. I can die for crying out loud!! My head was spinning with all these questions. I was so angry to think that I did go for my normal Pap test every year and wasted all that money because not once did they pick it up?
After a long 4 day wait I went back to the gynecologist. I was strapped in like a horse when she performed the biopsy and promised myself never to complain again when going for a Pap test. Dr. Watson phoned me a few days later as she needed to discuss the results with me and that she has scheduled an operation. My whole world stopped again. I could believe my ears. The test results showed that I have HPV type 16 and CIN III, the liquid test only showed CIN II. The worst part was when she said that if she cannot get everything out, I will have to go for a hysterectomy after three months, which means no babies! I’m 27 years old and she is telling me no babies!! I was hysterical.
While lying on the operating table I thought of all the people having such a jolly time with their families, it’s not fair but I know my life is much more worth than a slice of Christmas cake. I am one lucky girl as Dr. Watson confirmed the operation to be very successful, the end is almost here!!
Getting testedI have been intimate with my girlfriend for almost two years now and as of a couple of months ago, I noticed warts growing in the area where the penis meets the groin. I don’t have what most people commonly refer to as a clear complexion, quite the opposite really, and that’s precisely what I took these growths to be. I had begun shaving in the pubic area as an intimate courtesy and it was only through this shaving that I first noticed the growths. My history of bad skin coupled with the added irritation of shaving led me to believe these growths were a natural reaction.
After a week or two of unchanged status in the warts I went to the city clinic where I endured the gambit of STD testing as well as a visual examination of the growths. The doctor offered an acid treatment, but recommended a consultation for laser surgery, in which case, she preferred I had nothing done at this point. I don’t have health insurance and although I called and made an appointment at the city hospital, I don’t foresee laser removal as a realistic option.
Here is where the story gets a little strange. Two weeks ago, my girlfriend scheduled an HPV/Pap test to check herself out. One week ago she received the results: negative! Negative?? Prior to communicating my concerns for my own health I had revealed to my girlfriend that she was my first and only, despite comments I may have made that made it sound I were a bit more seasoned in intimate relationships. This fact is true. I have nothing to gain (and everything to lose) by lying about this further. So I found myself in a precarious situation which almost wanted her test to come out positive so we knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what was happening to me and if it was serious.
I scheduled for more testing at a clinic closer to where I lived in the suburbs. The visual examination here was much more definitive and decisive. The doctor immediately identified the growths as genital warts and treated them immediately with acid. I am to return to the clinic for continued treatments until the warts disappear. But now my girlfriend is left in a situation even more ambiguous than when we began. I explained the test results to the doctor at the second clinic to which she said that “It didn’t matter,” and she could still have some kind of lesion that caused this in the first place.
Our situation never degenerated into rampant distrust. I knew she had multiple partners in the past and she knew of my virginity after revealing it later on. I still love her very much, perhaps even now more so because revealing this to other family and friends and relying on their support would shame me to an exponential level. I could never live with that knowledge in their hands. This is something I must hide from all others in my life, but found the need to tell my tale during research into diagnosis and treatment. Here are the most important things I learned from this experience thus far:
It is much better to have health insurance and consequently, doctors and staff who seem more interested in wanting to actually help you.
People that work in the clinics are very focused on HIV testing. If you want them to look or test for something else, you MUST TELL THEM and you can only do that by doing some research on your own first. Again, bear in mind these doctors are more like factory line workers with your problems as opposed to a PCP.
Go for a second opinion, especially if the first one is free.
If you must keep things quiet to other friends and family, your partner is your only support. Continue to love him or her or end the relationship quickly!
Although some clinics have “counselors,” they are not the sort that actually talk to you and try to make you feel better after a positive viral diagnosis. This will require a LOT of soul searching if you don’t have a shrink and almost unbearable if you are not speaking with your partner.
I thought I was invincibleLike many, I was/am pretty well educated on STDs. However, I still felt that I was “invincible” to sexual diseases and NEVER would have expected to get one.
I have had three partners—all long-term serious relationships. At age seventeen, I’m not what most would expect an “HPV infected person(s)” to be. I graduated two years early, I was a cheerleader for my college, I graduated high school with a 4.0, I’ve held 2 state beauty pageant titles, and currently hold a local title on my way to state! The important thing is—NO ONE is invincible, and it can happen to ANYBODY. That’s part of the risk we take being sexually active.
In my case, knowledge is power. I discovered “skin-tag-like” warts on and around my vaginal opening. I figured it was an allergic reaction to a bubble bath or something. After a week of no improvements, I did research on genital warts on the internet. I was almost positive I had them. I told me mother and we went to the doctor, and I am now undergoing treatment.
Unlike many others, I was able to trace the source of my STD. It was my first boyfriend and first partner. He had no idea he was carrying the virus (since there are often no symptoms). Since me, he has had over 10 partners…meaning possibly infecting over 10 people. They say, “You sleep with whoever your partner has slept with.” Never has the saying affected me more. I called him and told him what I had, what he had, what he should do (regarding telling his past partners), treatment he should seek, and other key facts. Once again, knowledge is power.
I also called my most recent ex and partner in addition to the first. I was screamed at, and cursed, and he even threatened to kill me. It brought out a side I had never seen. It hurt, but I did the right thing. I now understand why STD prevention may be difficult–it is hard to tell someone, especially when you get such a harsh reaction. I can’t lie. It was embarrassing, heartbreaking, and shameful. But as I told him, STDs are just one part of the risk we take from being sexually active, especially as teens.
Now to my third partner—my fiance. I have infected him. We are going to a clinic (so his parents won’t find out) next week for him. Luckily there are many low cost and even free STD screening and treatment centers for cases just like this. It was so hard for us to get through this. He, unlike me, waited for “the one” before having sex. Being honored, I never once thought that I might be capable of transmitting a disease to him. As he put it at first, “It’s like working and working and working hard for something your whole life- and then having it blow up in your face.”
Yes, I gave my love an STD. The “perfect” varsity player with perfect grades. We found out that knowledge/education and communication is key. Though my communication issues were a bit more than just between us, it was something that had to be done. Something to think about. My first partner was angry, and so embarrassed, he refuses to tell the 10+ people he slept with. Assuming they follow a pattern, in a years span (since he started having sex with others)- they sleep with three males. That’s over 30 people infected because of someone not speaking the truth.
I have HPV. So does my fiance. We are normal- perhaps even considered “exceptional”—college students. His past: 0 partners. My past: 2 partners. All protected sex. We have HPV for the rest of my life. But we get through it together.
Rape and HPVAbout a year and one month ago, my high school coach raped me. He was my idol, my mentor, and one of my closest friends. He helped me to believe in myself, helped get me a scholarship to run at a university, and then helped me to train for my first season as a college athlete. I tried to push him off of me, but I guess it doesn’t matter.
Afterwards, I walked to my car, put my head down on my steering wheel and hyperventilated for a while— disbelief is what I like to call it. “Everyone has a skeleton and a closet to keep it in”—he’s mine. I wonder if he knows what he did. A few months later, I was diagnosed with HPV. He took everything from me, but at least he gave me something in return. “You’ve left me with nothing, but I’ve worked with less.”
Growing up in a life filled with sexual abuse and betrayal, my only defense is to forget…even when it’s happening. HPV makes it hard to forget – I am defenseless, now. When I was diagnosed, my doctor told me nothing about what I had and treated it as if it was nothing. I guess it probably was for her – she wasn’t on that table in nothing but a hospital gown. She didn’t shiver on top of that crinkly white paper while someone stuck something up inside her – maybe I shouldn’t have cared either. All these years I have been alone in my struggle with self-respect and trust. I have kept quiet, leaving my pain in little jars that I sometimes like to touch, trying to remember what it’s like to feel.
“I’ve been treated so wrong, I’ve been treated so long as if I’m becoming untouchable.” My saving grace was the hope that one day I would be far enough from my experiences that they wouldn’t hurt anymore. Last May, all of that changed with the diagnosis of HPV – a silent reminder of the pain that will follow me the rest of my life.
I recently entered into a relationship with the man that I hope to be my husband one day. He has been infinitely patient with me and with all of my fears. The second date we went on, we sat in the dark after watching a movie. Upon request, he gave me a pen and a piece of paper and waited while I scrawled a note to him stating that I had been raped and that I had HPV. I told him that he could take me or leave me, but to do it now. He didn’t leave.
The past couple of days, this “infection” has been especially painful…both physically and mentally. I had never realized that HPV could lead to cervical cancer – no one ever told me. I found out when a commercial came on TV about asking for the HPV test. I spent many nights doing research before the ad came on TV, but I just got frustrated and felt more and more disgusting. I couldn’t see through my tears to really understand what I was reading. When I saw that ad, it was as if someone had lifted a curtain and light came shining through.
The man I spoke of previously sent me an email today, with a link to this website in it. He pleaded with me to just take a look. He tried to tell me that I shouldn’t be ashamed, that I wasn’t alone.
I don’t really know where I’m going with this and I know that you will cut this down if you decide to put it up on your site. It’s ok even if you decide not to put it up at all. I’m not going to read over what I’ve written so that I don’t decide not to send it. Whoever you are, you’re one of the precious few that has any idea that this has happened to me. I’m sorry if this has been hard to understand… I’m just tired of silence. I just want someone to know.
I knew it was a risk for my health but...I’ve been dating the same boy for 10 years. We’ve been together since we were 16. This is the boy I’m willing to marry; the only one I’ve ever loved. Two years ago, I met a man who was 12 years my senior and completely drove me crazy. For the first time in my life I was going to be unfaithful. We had unprotected intercourse. I perfectly knew it was a risk for my health but…in those moments I did not care.
In February this year I went on for my annual Pap test and I found out I have HPV. I did not know anything about this disease. That man gave it to me. At first I thought my life was ruined, I had to talk with my boyfriend and with my father, who’s a doctor. So I did. It’s been difficult but my boyfriend decided to support me and he s still fighting with me, despite I could give him HPV. Today I’ve been told that I have high risk HPV, so I decided to write my story. HPV won’t let me down, I’ll fight and I’ll win. I thank God for my boyfriend support, and I thank your website for all your precious information.
Knowing that I’m not alone has made me feel normal againI just found out about a month ago that I have the type of HPV that causes warts. It had been six months since I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years so needless to say it was a another sting to an open wound, since I had not been with anyone since our breakup. I was so scared and angry when diagnosed. I’m 29 now and I had always been aware of STDs, and I made my last two boyfriends get checked for STDs before I had unprotected sex. Little did I know about HPV and that men could be carriers and not know it.
I racked my brain for so long to try and figure out who gave it to me…was it my boyfriend…did he cheat on me…did he already have it and not know it…did I have it before we dated and not know it?? I have finally been able to release all of those questions because I know it only adds stress to my life and will not make the HPV go away.
I’m still working on clearing the warts and regaining my spirit and health. I know in time it will all work out and it has defiantly made me respect my body that much more. Of the three friends that I talked to about my HPV, two of them confided that they have the high-risk HPV. Knowing that I’m not alone has really helped and has made me feel normal again.
I’m still scared to date and unsure how to deal with this. Two doctors I have spoken to have told me that in the beginning as long as I’m using condoms and I’m wart free I don’t need to tell anyone. But I wear my heart on my sleeve and I just don’t think I could be intimate with someone without them knowing. Plus at this point in my life I don’t feel the need to have sex with anyone until I know them well enough to have an STD talk. After all I still have to respect my body and do the best I can to protect myself from other STDs, and anyone that does not respect that is not someone I want to be intimate with.
'I encourage physicians to be honest with their patientsI was married for 20 years and my regular Pap smears were always normal. When a “no-fault” divorce completely traumatized my life, I was under tremendous stress. At one point I was working 7 days a week while going back to college full-time in order to get my degree, while at the same time running a household and raising a teenage son. (No-fault divorce has eliminated alimony and in many cases even child support; I was supporting my son and myself on a $10/hr job. Thanks to no-fault divorce laws, I did not qualify for food stamps either, or any other assistance.)
To make a long story short, I went for a Pap smear a year ago, and I was shocked to find that the result was abnormal. I couldn’t imagine how I could have contracted a sexually transmitted disease.
My family physician probably did not want to alarm me, so he merely suggested that I follow a regimen of special douches for a few months and then come back to see him after that. However, he did not tell me I had HPV. I assumed it was a minor problem such as a chronic yeast infection—although I was not experiencing any symptoms—so I did not go back. He did not call to follow-up, either. I changed jobs and doctors, and the first thing I did was go for a physical with a Pap smear; I was curious to see whether that yeast infection had disappeared. When the Pap smear was abnormal again, I was scared. And, I was angry with my previous physician for not telling me the facts. Had I known the abnormal Pap smear meant HPV, I certainly would have followed up with a treatment program.
I would encourage all physicians to be honest with their patients, and to provide information about HPV with every Pap smear.
Most importantly, I believe that stress is the reason for my suppressed immune system. More research needs to focus on the effects of stress on health. Thank you.
What a roller coaster ride this has beenI just want to take a moment to thank everyone who wrote in and to share my story. I was just diagnosed with high-risk HPV yesterday. What a roller coaster ride this has been. I received a call about about two weeks ago from my gynecologist’s secretary, in an OB/GYN practice, that I had to make an appointment to discuss my results. How nerve-wrecking it was to get a phone call like that. What made the whole situation worse is that I could not come in for my appointment until more than a week and a half later.
I tried to get as much information as possible about my results from the secretary and was told–in a not so pleasant way-—”all I can tell you is that is has something to do with your Pap smear.” So, I made the appointment and and tried to go on with business as usual…but of course I couldn’t. I did tons of internet searches on Pap Smear results and soon discovered HPV. After doing as much reading as I could possibly do, I came to the conclusion that I had HPV.
What is sad is that I am a public health professional and did not know about high-risk HPV. I only associated HPV with genital warts. I never knew that there was an HPV that was wart-less and caused cervical cancer. I know I made some not-too-bright decisions regarding my sexual activity, but for the most part I have always been pretty careful. I was regularly tested for STDs and had my partners tested for STDs when we started having a sexual relationship. I have only had 3 sexual partners and did not lose my virginity until I was 23. I’m 28 now.
When my doctor diagnosed me yesterday with HPV, even though I knew that this diagnosis was a very strong possibility, I was absolutely shocked. I have never had an STD before. I spent most of yesterday in a daze and remained in complete disbelief for the remainder of the day. But today is a brand new day and I am filled with brand new hope.
I want everyone on this website to feel as comfortable with being diagnosed with HPV as I now do. The truth is that almost every sexually active person will be diagnosed with HPV at some point in their lives…and it is not the end of the world. In fact, HPV testing is not a standard screen because it is so common. It doesn’t make sense to make a big deal out of it if its not causing any problems…which is often the case. But when an abnormal Pap Smear shows up, then you test for HPV so you can discover the origin of the abnormal cells. The good news is that regular Pap Smears can stop the progression of abnormal cells in their tracks. What’s even better news is that a healthy immune system naturally fights HPV and most people will test negative for HPV within a year or two—or even less.
The thing is, the virus is so common, its possible that you can be infected several times. The key for women is to be sure to have Pap tests regularly. Men, apparently you’re not affected at all by high-risk HPV. There are no clinical manifestations for you and no tests to determine if you have it. But you can give it to your sexual partner and if your partner has a cervix, it can infect her cervix and lead to abnormal cell growth.
I say all of this to say… KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT!!!
My miscarriageI found out I was infected with chlamydia a few months ago. About 2 months before that I was pregnant with my first child, which now I have found out that I miscarried my child because I was infected. I advise all to use protection as i can tell you it was hard enough finding out I had chlamydia let alone finding out it was the cause of my miscarriage! Now I have tried to fall pregnant again…I was extremely fertile before I had chlamydia and now I can’t even fall pregnant again. I’ve decided to just give my body a rest and just hope that I can conceive again. And to make things worse I will never no how long I had the infection for as my past partners refuse to be tested! So I’m stuck wandering who I caught it from and who I may have given it to. I had no symptoms that I noticed then now I know more about it I can say why didn’t I think something was wrong before!! It was because I didn’t know about it. I just hope that people will read this and think more carefully when going out or having sex because you always say to yourself “Oh well that’ll never happen to me,” and then it does and it ruins your life!
Thank you and I hope my story can help people to realize that you can get it and it can happen to you!
Why can't teens get tested?My name is Christina and I’m a 16 year old sophomore in high school. During my first year in high school I engaged in sexual activities. Ever since then, things haven’t been the same. I really want to go to a clinic and get tested for HIV/AIDS and STDs but I’m scared to let my parents know that I’m sexually active. No clinics would let me get tested without my parents and that’s a huge problem!
Many of my peers are going through the same thing with me. We want to get tested but refuse to tell our parents. This isn’t so good because, what if we are infected? How would we know? Would the infection only get worse? Well the point I’m trying to get across is that, there should clinics for teens to go to without their parents to get tested. I’m not saying this just because I’m terrified of my parents, but it’s been a thought on my mind for a while. Most teens would rather sit and let their infection grow other than telling their parents to take them to a clinic. Pregnancy testing shouldn’t be the only thing a teen can do without their parents’ consent. Please give me some feedback, maybe there are clinics that I don’t know about.
Editors note: You can search for a clinic that offers STD testing near you.
You made me feel like a person, not a statisticI am a 25 year old woman that was diagnosed with HPV about 2 months ago. I received an abnormal Pap smear result. I told my boyfriend at the time what was going on, and he flipped out, blaming me and yelling that I gave him this virus. I went for the colposcopy, and found out I had mild-moderate dysplasia and would have to have a LEEP procedure. I was terrified. I asked how I got the virus and what it was. When my doctor told me it was an STD, I started crying, thinking it was impossible. I had several partners in the past years, but made sure I always wore a condom and had thought I was being very careful. My doctor then explained to me that condom use does not always protect against HPV. I was outraged. I felt that for years, people have been lied to in a way. Education about sex and condoms does not include the fact that condoms do not protect against HPV.
The emotional strain this put on my relationship caused us to break up. I went in shortly thereafter for my LEEP procedure. I have been healing for about three weeks and am going for a checkup soon. I am scared that the Pap smear will come back abnormal again. I talked with my doctor previously to the LEEP and he found in my past Pap smears (dating 3 years ago), there was dysplasia present, just not severe enough to treat. They had assumed it would go away by itself. It is inconclusive if the strain I have now is recurrent or a new one, but it’s startling to think I have had this for so long without even knowing it.
In the past couple weeks, I started a relationship with another guy, and the subject of past sexual history came up. I took a chance and told him about the HPV, explaining what it was and how it’s contracted. He was very understanding, and admitted he had heard of the effects of the virus, but had never heard of HPV. The question still remains whether or not to abstain from sex, we have really hit it off and things are moving at a nice pace, but it was heart wrenching to tell him what was going on with me. I believe I got lucky with his reaction, as there is such a stigma surrounding the idea of contracting a STD. It is important people are educated on the fact that this is not your normal STD. Even with precautions, it is very contagious. I feel better knowing that myself, but I also feel people will not find out about this unless they are infected.
I do want to thank you for posting un-biased information on HPV. You made me feel like a person again, not a statistic.
HIV and TBAt fifteen I started playing high school sports. I was the average athlete playing basketball, football, and baseball. I was to my high school piers known as a square because I did not curse, drink, party or do drugs. I was voted ”Most Friendly” by my senior class at Lexington High. I was proud of my accomplishment in high school. I lettered in three varsity sports, I was voted MVP of the baseball team my senior year and I was told by my basketball coach before graduation that many things in life would come easier for me because I had God on my side.
At age 24, I started my career in hotel management, continued coaching little league and singing gospel music along the east coast. At age 28 is when I came “out of the closet” to my parents that I was gay and I was condemned to hell from my family. It was then that I left Lexington and moved to North Carolina continuing my career in hotel management, continuing my singing and visiting churches that loved me even though I was gay and allowed me to worship with them.
It is now the year 2000. I moved to Richmond and I met my life partner Brad in March and started a relationship that has blessed me tremendously. Have we had problems? Yes, the devil intervened and not being able to find a church that I was happy with, I backslid.
Four years later on July 22, 2004 at 7:00AM. While working 11-7 that night I developed some health problems that I had to seek medical attention for. It was then that I was diagnosed with HIV. I can still remember how I felt those first few minutes after the doctor had told me I had HIV. My partner Brad stood in the window waiting for some bad news but he never expected this bad news. So many questions crossed my mind at that time. Was my partner of 4 years going to leave me? How long was I going to live? Who gave it to me? What were my parents going to say? How many friends will I loose? It was a month later after having a biopsy that I was told also that not only did I have HIV but I had tuberculosis.
For months after my diagnosis I was bedridden. The side affect that I had from my HIV and TB medications were so severe that I remember telling my partner, “if this is what it takes to survive, I’m not sure I want to live”. Not able to eat anything solid for months I lost 39 pounds.
The good news is since my diagnosis I have found my reason for living. I don’t believe my health problems are because I am gay but because I needed a wake up call from God to get back into the ministry. The wake up call worked.
STD vs. STII am a health teacher at the high school level and I feel that changing STD to STI makes the issue not as important. Students see STI as something similar to a sinus infection, ear infection, yeast infection. All things that are curable and do not have long term side effects or cause other health issues (HPV/AIDS/genital warts—effect on babies born vaginally, etc.). This sends a very confusing message to the students. They understand that STDs are much more serious and view STIs as not that big of an issue because of the word “infection” vs. “disease.”
I would consider the thought process of a teenager (middle school-12-13 years old and high school 13-18). These are the groups that are having sex and not using protection. These students need to understand the implications of the choices of they make and changing meanings and definitions are just going to confuse the issue. Please reconsider the change from STD to STI.
Telling potential partners is terribly hardAt first i didn’t really think i had a problem. I went to a woman’s clinic a few weeks after I found out my boyfriend had cheated on me with at least 2 people. I told her I just wanted to make sure I hadn’t caught anything from him. About a month before I had met him (so would be 9 months up to that point) I had gone for my annual pap test and there were no problems. One week after that pap test I received a call from the doctor telling me that I was to see a GYN doc as i had signs of “pre-cancerous cells” on my cervix.
I went to the doctor and he performed some biopsies taking 4 pieces from my cervix which hurt tremendously. Another week went by and I received a call telling me that I had all 3 signs of precancerous cells on my cervix, calling it dysplasia (not one word of HPV or whatever I had). I was then scheduled for cervical laser surgery and told that it should take care of all my problems. The follow up pap was supposed to be 3 months after the surgery but due to cancellations and delays and emergencies (was supposed to be August ended up late February the next year). This time the follow up was with my family doctor and as I was having the pap I asked him about these really small itchy bumps I could feel there and I wanted to know what they were.
He told me rather abruptly and without care “The doctor had to have told you that you have HPV and also genital warts when he treated you right?” Well let’s just say my mouth dropped and I was stunned. I not only didn’t know that I had HPV I had no clue I had genital warts until that moment and I really didn’t even understand what he said. I came home and started reading up on it and as you can imagine i became increasingly upset. I hadn’t been with anyone for 8 years before this guy, and had never had an abnormal pap before that. I was devastated, he put me on Aldara for 16 weeks and all it did was make them itchier and larger. He then determined to laser them off. The healing for that took a month and now I am scarred with pigment loss where all the lesions were. I have had a few come back which have been acid removed but still it’s one of the most depressing, hardest things I have ever had to deal with. Telling potential partners is terribly hard.
I haven’t seen any in about 7 months now so hoping it’s finally, hopefully, going to clear up as far as being there visibly. I have been dealing with this for 5 years now and not sure if it will ever end. I have heard of a few here who have gotten this HPV and because they are lesion-free for 6 months they feel they have gotten rid of it, therefore not telling partners about it. I am totally upset about the misconceptions about this STD, as it gets so many people and they don’t think anything of it.
When I told one of the girls where I worked that I had pre-cancerous cells on my cervix she matter of fact told me that she’s had that done 4 times. I don’t think she was aware of how bad this can be. Unfortunately for me I was passed on at least 2 types, the low risk and the high risk and I was not informed by my own doctor at the time. By the doctor taking a year to tell me I feel that was irresponsible as I may have infected someone in that year.
That’s what happened to me, hopefully they will come up with something that will get rid of this in people who already have it and not just prevent it from happening. Thank you for reading my story.
Why isn't there more awareness?I am 23 years old and have only been sexually active for one year. My first partner and I went to the city clinic to be tested for HIV and STDs. When they told us we were negative on everything I thought there was nothing else to worry about. I got on the pill and we made it a point to always use a condom. I thought I was being safe but little did I know there was something called HPV and my boyfriend at the time carried the virus. I went for a routine pap three months ago and was told that I had HPV and that it was in its 3rd stage of its growth (the fourth is cancer). I went through a freezing process in hope that it would remove my abnormal cells. My cells regenerated and I’m incredibly upset that i never heard about this (HPV) until I had it. Why wasn’t there more awareness? Why can’t we find more ways to test men? If I had known my ex-boyfriend carried the virus I wouldn’t have slept with him. I am mad that now I have deal with this condition and go through further treatments simply because there wasn’t enough awareness to warn me.
How did I end up with an STD?I am 34 years old. I have been married for 6 years and have had only one sex partner who is my husband in my life. I have two beautiful kids, a girl and a boy. I recently got diagnosed with genital warts. I am so confused, frustrated, sad, angry, worried and stress. My life seems over. I think it will be hard for me to find full happiness again. Genital warts, the ugly stuff, will always be staying in the back of my mine.
I strongly believe in monosex partner in life time and have been practicing my belief. Here I am ended up with a STD.
Silent diseases are easy to ignoreI was first diagnosed with high-risk HPV about a year and a half ago, with the discovery of genital warts on a follow-up visit after biopsy. Even though I consider myself relatively well-informed and compassionate on the subject of STD transmission (i.e. they aren’t necessarily caught due to promiscuous behavior, I didn’t think any less of someone who had one), I wasn’t prepared for the feelings of shame, guilt, and fear I experienced.
Although I tried to go in for a colposcopy as soon as possible, in hindsight I was not emotionally prepared. The doctor, who was highly recommended but simply average at my visit, could not perform a biopsy because I was physically shaking. At the time, I was dealing with graduation from college, a love affair gone wrong, problems with anxiety, and the fact that I now had an STD. The reason many women find putting off treatment a viable option most likely has to do with the fact that their diagnosis is hidden. To this day most of my friends, not to mention my family, do not know that I have been treated for cervical dysplasia and genital warts. Even if a person has every good intention to seek treatment, having to live with a disease as a secret makes it that much more terrifying to admit that, “yes, I have an STD,” when it comes time to make those appointments.
I do not consider myself squeamish or easily intimidated by gynecological exams, but every time I went in to get treated I was overcome with feelings of sadness, anger, and fear. I also moved to a new city in the interim, and it took nearly four months to get all my paperwork in one place even though my boyfriend worked at the institute where my new gynecologist is. I can only imagine how hard it is for everyone who has to get their records in order without professional help.
I would also postulate that because HPV is an invisible epidemic, it is easier to go without treatment. Silent diseases are easy to ignore. Thanks to the work done on AIDS, cancer, and other high-profile diseases, no one would argue that anyone with these diseases should put off treatment. But for ailments such as HPV, thryoid dysfunction, and PMDD (which, interestingly enough, all of whose effects are more prominent or only occur in women), many people go throughout their lives without even a diagnosis, much less full treatment.
Thank you again for providing this valuable resource. Every article or new statistic we have access to allows us to shed a bit more secrecy and come to accept both the fact of having HPV, and preparing ourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally for all necessary treatment.
HPV TestI was twenty three and had not had a pap in over 2 years when I went. My test came back abnormal so I then had to get another test done which was a HPV test and that came back positive. My cells were at a high level for cancer. I had to get my cervix froze hoping it would remove all the abnormal and cancer cells. I had to go back to the doctor three months later to get another test which thankful came back negative. I’m thankful every day that this was detected because I’m not sure what might have happened. Please ask for the test when you get your pap. It can and will save your life.

Search this websiteGonorrhea
Gonorrhea is a curable infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In 2015 395,216 cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the actual number of gonorrhea cases in the U.S. each year is thought to be closer to 820,000. It is transmitted during vaginal, anal, and oral sex (performing or receiving). Many men infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, while most women do not. Even when women do have symptoms, they can be mistaken for a bladder infection or other vaginal infection.
Since symptoms may not be present, the only way for a person who has been at risk for gonorrhea to tell whether they’re infected is to be tested. Gonorrhea can be diagnosed through a urine test or by taking a specimen from the infected area. If left untreated, gonorrhea can cause complications such as PID and infertility.
Yearly gonorrhea testing is recommended for all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Using latex condoms from the very beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact reduces the risk of transmission of gonorrhea.
FAQs
What is gonorrhea?Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), also known as “the clap.” It is a curable infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoea. The bacteria targets the cells of the mucous membranes including:
the surfaces of the urethra, vagina, cervix and endometrium
the fallopian tubes
the anus and rectum
the lining of the eyelid
the throat
How is it transmitted?
Gonorrhea is passed during vaginal sex, oral sex (performing or receiving), or anal sex. It can be passed when the mucous membrane, the soft skin covering all the openings of the body, comes into contact with the mucous membrane secretions or semen of an infected person.
Gonorrhea can be passed even if the penis or tongue does not go all the way into the vagina or anus. If the vagina, cervix, anus, penis or mouth come in contact with infected secretions or fluids; then transmission is possible.
Even a woman who has not had anal sex can get gonorrhea in the anus or rectum if bacteria are spread from the vaginal area, such as when wiping with toilet paper.
Eye infections in adults may result when discharge caries the disease into the eye during sex or hand-to-eye contact.
It can also be passed from mother to newborn as the baby passes through the infected birth canal. This can result in eye infections, pneumonia or other complications
Gonorrhea is not passed through things like shaking hands or toilet seats.
In children, gonorrhea may be a possible sign of sexual abuse.
What are the symptoms?Many men exhibit symptoms within two days to five days after exposure, with a possible range of one to 30 days. Although most women infected will remain asymptomatic (without symptoms), women who develop symptoms will do so within 10 days of infection.
Men may be asymptomatic (without symptoms) but might experience:
Yellowish-white discharge from the penis
Burning or pain when urinating
Urinating more often than usual
Pain or swelling of the testicles
Women are usually asymptomatic (without symptoms) but might experience:
Abnormal discharge from the vagina that is yellow and sometimes bloody.
Burning or pain when urinating
When the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes, some women still have no signs or symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms, which can be an indication that the infection has progressed to pelvic inflammatory disease: lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, pain during intercourse, bleeding between menstrual periods, nausea, fever
Both men and women might have rectal or anal infection. Symptoms are usually not present in about 90% of cases. When present, symptoms include anal or rectal itching, discharge, and pain during defecation.
Gonorrhea infections of the mouth and throat are usually without symptoms. If present, symptoms include soreness and redness in the mouth or throat. A culture test is used to determine if gonorrhea is causing these symptoms.
If gonorrhea infects the eye, men and women might experience conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelid lining). Symptoms of conjunctivitis include redness, itching, and discharge from the eye.
The most common symptoms in newborns include conjunctivitis and pneumonia, which usually develop 5 to 12 days after birth.
How is gonorrhea diagnosed?There are several different testing options for gonorrhea such as urine or swab tests. It may be helpful to speak to your health care provider about what testing options they have available.
People infected with gonorrhea are often also infected with chlamydia; therefore, in patients with gonorrhea treatment is often prescribed for chlamydia as well, since the cost of the treatment is less than the cost of testing for chlamydia. According to the 2002 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, health care providers do not need to consider re-testing patients after treatment unless the patient still has symptoms or if reinfection is suspected.
How is gonorrhea treated?There are antibiotic treatments that are effective in treating gonorrhea. Some strains of gonorrhea have been found to be resistant to certain drugs (known as antimicrobial resistance), so the recommended treatment for most cases involves two antibiotics: one delivered as an injection and the other as an oral medication (usually just a single pill).
Patients with gonorrhea should also be treated for chlamydia (unless testing has ruled out chlamydia infection).
Here are some important points about treatment:
All medications should be taken as directed.
All partners should be examined and treated.
Sexual contact should be avoided until the patient and all partner(s) have been treated and cured.
Persons with symptoms after treatment should be tested again by culture.
Persons who were treated with a non-recommended course of antibiotics (sometimes done if a patient is allergic or the drugs are unavailable) should also be tested again one week after treatment, even if they have no symptoms.
Infections detected after treatment with the recommended medications more commonly occur because of reinfection rather than treatment failure.
What does it mean for my health?If untreated, gonorrhea can cause complications in men, women and infants. Untreated gonorrhea infections in men may lead to:
Prostatitis: inflammation of the prostate gland
Scarring of the urethra, which can cause a narrowing or closing of the urethra
Infertility
Epididymitis: inflammation of the epididymis, the elongated, sperm-carrying, cord-like structure along the posterior border of the testes
Untreated gonorrhea infections in women may lead to:
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID can develop from several days to several months after infection with gonorrhea. Left untreated, PID can cause infertility.
Chronic menstrual difficulties
Postpartum endometritis: inflammation of the lining of the uterus after childbirth
Miscarriage
Cystitis: inflammation of the urinary bladder
Mucopurulent cervicitis: characterized by a yellow discharge from the cervix.
About 1% of men or women with gonorrhea may develop Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI), which is sometimes called gonococcal arthritis. DGI occurs when gonorrhea infection spreads to sites other than genitals, such as the blood, skin, heart, or joints.
Symptoms of DGI include fever, multiple skin lesions, painful swelling of joints (arthritis), infection of the inner lining of the heart, and inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Symptoms of DGI in infants include arthritis, meningitis and sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood
DGI can be successfully treated using antibiotic regimens similar to those recommended for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea.
Gonorrhea can be passed from mother to newborn as the baby passes through the infected birth canal. Complications in infants include: blindness, from untreated eye infections.
How can I reduce my risk?
Abstinence (not having sex) is a sure way to eliminate risk of infection.
Mutual monogamy (having sex with only one uninfected partner) is another way to eliminate risk.
Water-based spermicides are not recommended for the prevention of gonorrhea. Recent studies have shown that nonoxynol-9 (“N-9”), which is found in most water-based spermicides, is not effective in preventing gonorrhea.
Using latex condoms for vaginal and anal sex will reduce risk.
Since gonorrhea can be transmitted even if the penis or tongue does not completely enter the vagina, mouth or rectum, using latex condoms at the beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact is the best form of prevention.
Several barrier methods can be used to reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea during oral sex. A non-lubricated condom can be used for mouth-to-penis contact. Household plastic wrap, a dental dam, or a latex condom cut-up and opened flat can reduce the risk of transmission during mouth-to-vulva/vagina or oral-anal (rimming) contact.
How do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard, but keep in mind that most people with an STD don’t know they have it. It’s important that you talk to your partner as soon as possible so she or he can get treatment. It is possible to pass gonorrhea back and forth, so if you get treated and your partner doesn’t, you may get infected again.

Search this websiteHepatitis B Virus: Five Things to Know
Hepatitis B is a virus that causes inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be experienced as an “acute” infection causing mild illness for a few weeks or months or as a more serious “chronic” infection lasting a lifetime. Chronic HBV infection can cause complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and even lead to liver cancer.
Hepatitis B is More Common Than You Think
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates as many as 2.2 million persons in the U.S. are living with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis B Is Most Commonly Transmitted Through Sexual Contact
Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, and blood. HBV is most often transmitted through sexual contact but can also be contracted when injecting drug users share needles and other injecting equipment. Mothers with HBV can also pass the virus to their infants during birth.
But Most Don’t Know They Have It
Adults often have few – if any- symptoms. When they occur, symptoms can be mistaken for the flu (nausea and vomiting, malaise, loss of appetite and abdominal pain). Some people with hepatitis B also experience jaundice, a yellowing of the eyes or skin.
The Only Way to Know is to Get Tested
The only way to know for sure is to test! Ask your health care provider if a test for HBV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are right for you. Special blood tests are used that can detect either HBV particles or antibodies (proteins in the blood your body produces against infections). Blood tests can determine if someone with hepatitis B has an acute or chronic infection.
It’s Easy to Prevent
Use male or female condoms (sometimes called external or internal condoms) each time you have sex. While they don’t provide 100% protection against hepatitis B and other STIs, when used consistently and correctly condoms are one of the best ways to reduce your risk for hepatitis B and other STIs. Those sharing households with someone diagnosed with HBV should contact with infected blood or other body fluids directly or on objects such as needles, razors, toothbrushes, and the like. Clean surfaces contaminated with blood or other body fluids with a solution of 1 part household bleach and 10 parts water.
There is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B! CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccination for sex partners of anyone who has hepatitis B; anyone who is sexually active but not in a long-term, monogamous relationship; those treated for STD/STIs; and men who have sex with men. Others may benefit from vaccination against HBV so ask your health care provider what is recommended for you.

Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted at their June 2019 meeting to align their HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females through age 26 and to also recommend shared clinical decision making for previously unvaccinated men and women between the ages of 27 and 45.
Organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACIP is the main body that makes vaccine program recommendation in the U.S.
ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls ages 11-12 with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those who previously didn’t receive (or complete) the series of shots. This harmonizes HPV vaccine recommendations for males and females (before the June vote the catch-up recommendation for males was only up to age 21).
The vaccine protects against the “high risk” HPV types that cause a number of cancers including approximately 90% of cervical cancers globally. It also blocks infections with two “low risk” HPV types found with most cases of genital warts.
In 2018 the indication for the HPV vaccine was expanded to include use with men and women 27-45 and shared clinical decision making means ACIP recommends patients in this group discuss the vaccine with their health care provider to see if it’s right for them.
For more on HPV vaccines read ASHA’s FAQ here.

Abortion Rights Threatened
June 7, 2019
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and several other state legislatures recently passed “heartbeat bills” prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat becomes detectable. Furthermore, It’s actually up in the air just how long Missouri’s only clinic providing abortion services will keep its doors open.
Fetal heartbeats can be detected after just a few weeks, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. This type of legislation effectively bans abortion (although legal challenges mean the issue is far from settled). If they stand, medical staff who break these laws could be prosecuted under felony criminal charges, adding another chilling effect on women’s ability to access reproductive health care.
ASHA, in conjunction with our partners, works to educate policy makers and other stakeholders on important sexual health issues and we encourage you to get involved. Visit our policy page and make your voice heard.

This is a wonderful way to create your own legacy or to honor your family or a family member and ensure the continued excellence of ASHA’s programs and services.
Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form.

Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

ASHA’s work is focused around three important objectives:
Educate: Be the source of scientifically-based and accessible information
Build Alliances: Collaborate with other organizations to expand the understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model
Advocate: Advance supportive changes in sexual health policy
Educate
Thousands of individuals turn to ASHA each year looking for information and guidance from a reliable source. Our many websites and publications serve as a critical means of information and support to users around the world who have difficulty accessing clear, non-biased information on sexual and reproductive health. From individuals with questions on sexually transmitted infections, to parents looking for advice on how to talk to their kids about sexual health, to patients looking for support, ASHA is a trusted resource. And with our grassroots program the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, we also offer that education and support in local communities as well.
Our education efforts extend to specific audiences beyond the general public, including healthcare providers. From the creation of continuing education programs for physicians to the development of resources such as toolkits, videos and apps geared toward providers, ASHA works to ensure that providers can offer the best sexual health care to their patients.
With their ability to reach wide audience, the media are also an important target of ASHA’s outreach. We work with a wide range of media outlets—TV, radio, print media, and popular web outlets—as a sought-after commentator on news and trends in popular culture that touch on sexual health issues, promoting positive coverage that destigmatizes the subject.
Build Alliances
We work with a number of national organizations and that share our goals of promoting sexual health issues in order to strengthen advocacy for sexual health promotion. ASHA is a key member of such entities as the National Sexual Health Coalition, the North American Federation of Sexual Health Organizations, and Cervical Cancer Free America. We also regularly bring together and consult with professionals in the field to promote better understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model.
Advocate
ASHA maintains a policy office in Washington, DC, affirming its long-term commitment to advocacy for systemic change. ASHA’s Washington office works to secure sound policy responses to the sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic in the areas of prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and education through efforts with policymakers and national organizations. ASHA has been successful in obtaining bipartisan support for STI programs and continues to educate policy makers about the economic, social, and public health benefits of appropriate STI policy.
We work in coalition with organizations in family planning, HIV, and women’s health, as well as organizations representing people of color and faith-based groups to keep STIs on the forefront of the policy agenda. ASHA is routinely asked to provide strategy and content advice on sexual health-related issues to a variety of national organizations and also provides leadership on numerous boards and committees.

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteUnderstanding LARC
The name says it all. Long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, is reversible birth control that provides long-lasting (think years) pregnancy prevention. While not currently the leading choice among women, LARC use has been on the rise in recent years. In women aged 15-44, LARC use has grown from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011–2013. The rising popularity of LARC can likely be attributed to its high rate of effectiveness (more than 99 percent) and ease of use.
LARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable—research has shown LARC to be 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the vaginal ring. One important reason why is the LARC removes the “user error” factor that can make other methods less effective. No need to remember to take a pill daily, or have a diaphragm on hand ready to go. Once LARC is in place, it does its job for years with no input from the user at all, acting as a “set it and forget it” method.
But there’s one thing that shouldn’t be forgotten—protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While LARC is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, LARC methods don’t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.
ASHA’s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses dual use of LARC and condoms in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast. Fred explains the facts about LARC and the added benefit of dual use of LARC and condoms to prevent STIs.
LARC Methods
There are two LARC methods: the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant. The intrauterine device (IUD) was once a popular choice in the U.S., but following problems linked to the poorly designed Dalkon Shield model in the 1970s, usage dropped due to concerns about safety. The current newly designed models share none of the earlier safety concerns, but some misconceptions about this issue persist.
The birth control implant has been available in the United States since the 1990s. The earliest model, Norplant, included multiple rods implanted under the skin and offered pregnancy prevention for up to five years. Almost immediately after its approval, however, it became a target for misuse, as legislation was introduced in several states mandating its use in specific groups of women, including those receiving public assistance. Use of implants became an issue in the courts, as women facing charges including child and abuse and neglect were offered the option of accepting implants as condition of a reduced sentence.
Understanding and acknowledging this history of coercive use of LARC and safety concerns is important, to avoid problems of the past. But so too is understanding the potential value of LARC methods today. The current concern with LARC is making sure women are well informed about these methods, including benefits and side effects, and making LARC an accessible and affordable option to all women.
IUD: An IUD is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. It works by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The hormonal type of IUD also thins the uterine lining, making it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.
There are two types of IUDs:
Hormonal IUD: This plastic IUD releases the hormone progestin. One type, Mirena, is approved for use for up to 5 years, while another, Skyla, is approved for use for up to 3 years.
Copper IUD: The copper IUD, Paraguard, is hormone-free. It is approved for use for up to 10 years.
While both types of IUDs can remain in place for years, they can also easily be removed if a woman decides she would like to become pregnant. Most women have no issues with the IUD, but problems can include spotting between periods, a heavier flow (with Paraguard), and back pains. Rare but serious problems can occur as well, and usually happen shortly after the IUD is inserted. These complications include the IUD falling out of the uterus, or piercing the uterine wall. Learn more about IUDs and hear stories from real women who use this method at Bedsider.
Implant: The birth control implant is a single small, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women’s upper arm by a healthcare provider. The rod releases the hormone progestin into the body, which both helps prevent ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, helping prevent sperm from reaching an egg. The implant prevents pregnancy for up to 3 years.
As with the IUD, the implant can be removed at any time if a woman decides to get pregnant. The most common side effect is irregular bleeding—including spotting between periods and heavier periods. This typically improves over time. Learn more about implants and hear stories of women using this method at Bedsider.
Choosing LARC
So with all the potential benefits, why is LARC not a more popular choice? One reason is the large upfront cost. Both methods must be inserted, and removed, by a physician and costs cannot be spread out over time as with other methods. However, under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance plans in the health insurance marketplace must cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods prescribed by a woman’s doctor, including LARC.
Another factor involves misconceptions about safety, even on the part of providers. In a 2012 study, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly a third of healthcare providers had misconceptions about the safety of IUDs for women who have never had children. Such concerns are misplaced—the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that LARC methods be offered as first-line birth control methods and encouraged as options for most women, including adolescents and women who have never had children.
LARC offers women a safe, long-lasting choice for preventing pregnancy—one that requires no real thought or effort over years. It’s an option that most women should consider a viable choice.

Search this websiteThe Female Condom Gets a New Name
September 27, 2018
Good news for sexual health advocates: in a final order issued today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the classification of female condoms from a class III device to a lower-risk class II device—the same classification shared by male condoms. The change will make it easier for manufacturers to bring the product to market, as the regulatory requirements for a class II device are lower than for the class III.
The order also includes a new name for the product. The “single-use female condom” will now be called the “single-use internal condom,” reflecting its potential use during anal sex—a new indication for the product. Currently, only one female condom—the FC2 Female Condom—is available in the U.S., and it is sold by prescription. For those without insurance, it is also available for purchase online through the manufacturer, and may be available for patients at health departments or clinics. This new FDA ruling classifies the
single-use
internal condom as an over-the-counter (OTC) device, opening the door for greater access.
“The device is assigned the generic name single-use internal condom, and it is identified as an OTC sheath-like device that lines the vaginal or anal
wall and is inserted into the
vagina or anus prior to the initiation
of
coitus. At the conclusion of coitus, it is removed and discarded. It is indicated for contraception and/or
prophylactic (preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted
infections) purposes.”
The reclassification comes after years of advocacy efforts seeking the change to help improve access. This is reflected in the public comments to the FDA in support of the change. As the FDA order notes,
the “overwhelming
majority of commenters supported the proposed reclassification,
name change, and the general effort to increase patient access to single-use internal condoms.”

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteSafer Sex Tools for Relationships
Once you have decided on your own “safer sex” boundaries, you will need to gather the tools you will need to stick to your decisions. Some of the most common “tools” are included below:
Condoms and Other Contraceptives
Currently, condoms are the only widely available, proven method for reducing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during intercourse. ASHA supports the promotion and use of condoms to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently. For more about condom do’s and don’ts click here.
Using a lubricant with condoms makes them both more enjoyable and less likely to break. Click below to see condom options:
Latex male condom
Advantages
Inexpensive
Accessible, the most common type of condom
Available in a variety of colors, textures, thicknesses, and sizes
Malleable and stretchy
Disadvantages
Can NOT be used with oils or oil-based lubes
Will degrade in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
Polyurethane (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Good for those with a latex sensitivity/allergy
Thin, so transmits warmth well
Safe with oil-based lubes
Disadvantages
Does not conform as tightly to a penis, so it may slip off more easily
Not as stretchy as latex, so it may break more easily and may fit a limited range of penis sizes
Polyisoprene (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Good for those with a latex sensitivity
Malleable and stretchy like latex
Disadvantages
Can NOT be used with oil-based lubes
Will degrade (break down) in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
Lambskin (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Feels “natural”
Good for those with a latex sensitivity (but do not protect against STIs/STDs!)
Disadvantages
DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST STIs/STDs, only pregnancy
Looser fit than latex
Female condom
Female condom, made of polyurethane or nitrile.
Advantages
Outer ring covers a larger surface area, protects more of a woman’s mucous membrane
Good for those with latex sensitivity
A man does not have to pull out as soon as he ejaculates, as he would with male condoms.
Wearer can be in control
Can insert condom up to eight hours before sex
Disadvantages
Some say the outer ring irritates the clitoris and vulva
Expensive
Difficult to find
Cannot be used at the same time as a male condom
Slippage is common
May be uncomfortable for the receiver of anal sex
Male condom options include not just the type of material, but size as well. When it comes to condoms, size does matter. Learn more about condom sizing.
In addition to condoms, there are many other forms of contraceptives that you may choose to use. You can refer to our birth control method comparison chart to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of other forms of birth control.
Lubricant
A good lubricant (lube) is one of the most important tools in your sexual toolkit. Lube reduces friction which can cause tiny tears in the skin, which make it more likely for the person to get an infection if his/her partner has one. Lube can also make sex feel better, whether having intercourse, masturbating, having oral sex, or using sex toys.
In addition, condoms work better and are less likely to tear when you use lube. Lube can also make oral sex with a barrier more enjoyable for the female receiving it.
Women self-lubricate their vaginas when they are turned on, but many factors may reduce lubrication: alcohol or other drugs (including hormonal birth control, stimulants, antihistamines, antidepressants, chemotherapy), monthly hormonal changes, peri-menopause, menopause, breastfeeding, a history of sexual assault, and other psychological and physical factors. Women may want extra lubrication on the vulva and clitoris during sex, as lubrication from the vagina often does not reach these external areas.
The anus does not self-lubricate, and you always need to use a lubricant to prevent the very fragile skin of the anus from tearing during anal play or intercourse. Most people like an anal lubricant thicker than those used for vaginal sex.
NOTE: Avoid any lubricant with lidocaine or benzocaine, which dull the body’s natural defense (pain), which lets you know when something is wrong, including tearing of the skin.
Below are types of lubricants you might choose, with advantages and disadvantages of each:
Saliva
Advantages
Free
Accessible
Disadvantages
Not as slippery as others
May spread infection if the saliva of an infected person is used as the lubricant
Dries up more quickly than others
Oil/petroleum-based lubricants
Includes such lubricants as Vaseline and baby oil.
Advantages
Great for external male masturbation
Inexpensive and accessible
Disadvantages
NOT for vaginal use
NOT for use with latex condoms or toys
Stains fabric
Natural/plant-based oils
Includes coconut, grapeseed, apricot, jojoba, olive oils; Crisco
Advantages
Great for massage
All-natural
Safe to eat
Moisturizing–good for dry skin
Inexpensive and accessible
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Absorbed into the skin
Disadvantages
NOT for use with latex condoms or toys
Stains fabric
Can go rancid
Water-based lubricants
Advantages
Doesn’t stain fabric
Latex-friendly
Some come flavored for oral sex
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Disadvantages
Some ingredients may be irritating for sensitive skin (glycol,parabens, glycerin, flavorings, nonoxodyl-9).
Dries out quickly (Use saliva or water to reconstitute.)
Silicone lubes
Advantages
Latex-friendly
Stays slick in water (i.e. hot tubs)
Stays slippery longer than others
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Disadvantages
Expensive
Stains sheets
NOT to be used with silicone or cyber skin toys
Must be washed off with soap and water
May make surfaces such as floors and showers slippery
Barriers for Oral Sex
Barriers used during oral sex can help prevent transmission of STIs. Options include:
Dental dams (latex)
Advantages
Thicker than plastic wrap, less likely to tear
Disadvantages
Cannot be used with oil or oil-based lubes
Latex will degrade in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
May be difficult to find
Limited range of sizes
Plastic Wrap
Plastic wrap (a.k.a. cling wrap), non-latex(i.e. Saran Wrap. Use a non-microwavable type.
Advantages
Easily accessible
Inexpensive
Can have exactly the size you want and need
Good for those with latex sensitivity or allergy
Disadvantages
Thinner than dental dams so may tear more easily
Sex toys
Sharing sex toys (like vibrators, for example) can be risky if they have vaginal fluids, blood, or feces on them. Sharing sex toys without cleaning them or using a condom can potentially expose a person to STIs.
The safest practice is not to share sex toys. If sex toys are shared, a condom should be used. With toys that can be inserted into the vagina or anus, a person may put a condom onto the toy. For shared toys in which the penis is inserted, a condom may be worn. It is important to change the condom before another person uses the toy so that any body fluids or infectious organisms on the sex toy are not passed on to the partner. It is also important to change the condom when moving from the anus to the vagina to prevent possible infection.
When cleaning sex toys, look to see what the manufacturer’s instructions recommend. Some may be best cleaned with soap and water, while certain types of may be made from materials, such as silicone, that are dishwasher safe.

October 8, 2018
On October 5, 2018 the FDA approved use of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine in males and females ages 27-45, expanding the previous indication that covered from ages 9-26. Gardasil 9 prevents infections with the “high risk” HPV types most commonly found in a number of cancers worldwide, including cervical cancer. The vaccine also protects against “low risk” HPV types associated with most cases of genital warts.
HPV infections are common and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 14 million Americans are diagnosed with HPV each year. While most HPV infections are harmless and clear naturally, the sheer number of cases make it a key public health priority. In the U.S. about 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year and the burden is much higher globally. “High risk” HPV types also are associated with vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, and many head and neck cancers.
To learn more about the HPV vaccine check out the FDA’s press announcement.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteNew Poll Shows Majority Support ACA Birth Control Benefit
July 13, 2017
A majority of Americans (68 percent) support the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement that employers to cover the full cost of prescription birth control as part of their health insurance plans, according to a June 2017 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. This support extends across political party lines, with 81 percent of democrats, 54 percent of republicans and 68 percent independents supporting this benefit.
The poll also showed that a majority oppose to exemptions to this requirement on the basis of religious or moral grounds. While a 2014 Supreme Court decision established that “closely held” for-profit corporations could be exempt from the birth control requirement if their owners had religious objections, the Trump administration has suggested expanding this exemption to include a broader group of employers who object to birth control for either religious or moral reasons. Yet more American oppose exemptions for religious (53 percent) or moral (55 percent) reasons that support them.

Search this websitePrEP: HIV Prevention in a Pill
When you think of HIV prevention, condoms are probably the first thing that comes to mind.  This is great as condoms are a proven method to reduce your risk of contracting HIV or other STIs during sexual intercourse. However, there is another option for those who may be at a higher risk for HIV- pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.PrEP involves taking a pill once daily to prevent HIV infection in someone who is HIV-negative. The pill—approved by the FDA as PrEP in 2012 and marketed under the brand name Truvada—contains a combination of two antiretroviral drugs that stop the virus from reproducing in the body. When taken consistently, every day, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by more than 90%.
So who is PrEP recommended for? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers these guidelines on people who should consider taking PrEP:
Anyone who is in an ongoing relationship with someone who is HIV-positive.
Gay or bisexual men who have had anal sex without a condom or have been diagnosed with an STI in the past 6 months.
Heterosexual men or women who do not regularly use condoms with partners with an unknown HIV status who are at substantial risk for HIV infections (e.g. people who inject drugs).
People who have injected illicit drugs in the past 6 months and have shared injection equipment or have been in treatment for injection drug use in the past 6 months.
While PrEP is recommended for different groups, it has received the most attention in the gay community. Gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected by HIV: in 2013, they accounted for 81% estimated HIV diagnoses among all males aged 13 years and older and 65% of all persons receiving an HIV diagnosis that year. Given these alarming statistics, PrEP has been endorsed as an important prevention tool by a number of prominent activists and organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, AIDS United, and the World Health Organization.
However, PrEP has garnered some controversy as well. Among the criticisms is one that echoes the controversy that surrounds HPV vaccines—the assumption that PrEP will lead to risky sexual behavior and promote promiscuity. But as with HPV vaccination, research has shown that such fears are unfounded. A study of the multinational iPrEx study that first established the effectiveness of a daily dose of Truvada to prevent HIV found “no evidence of risk compensation that would offset the benefits of PrEP.” In other words, no evidence that taking PrEP led to risky sexual behavior. In fact, the reverse was true. As the study authors note, “Indeed, participation in the study was associated with safer sexual behavior.”
Another concern voiced is that PrEP will cause gay and bisexual men to abandon condoms, which have been a mainstay of HIV prevention efforts. But an analysis by CDC shows condom use on the declinebefore the approval of Truvada as PrEP in 2012. The CDC data indicate that in 2011, 57 percent of men who have sex with men reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the previous 12 months, up from 48 percent in 2005. Given the decline in condom use, the availability of another prevention method should be welcomed.
But this not to suggest that PrEP replaces condoms. Far from it. Rather, PrEP offers a new option to those at high risk—another tool in the HIV prevention toolbox that fits alongside condoms, not as a replacement. After all, while PrEP helps prevent HIV infection, condoms offer protection against a host of other STIs as well.
Despite the promise offered by PrEP, it is necessarily the right choice for everyone. In addition to requiring taking a pill every day consistently, those on PrEP are also advised to see their healthcare provider regularly for follow up and get tested for HIV every 3 months. But for those willing to take on the commitment, PrEP offers the promise of a highly effective way to prevent HIV.

Search this websiteGonorrhea
Gonorrhea is a curable infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In 2015 395,216 cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the actual number of gonorrhea cases in the U.S. each year is thought to be closer to 820,000. It is transmitted during vaginal, anal, and oral sex (performing or receiving). Many men infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, while most women do not. Even when women do have symptoms, they can be mistaken for a bladder infection or other vaginal infection.
Since symptoms may not be present, the only way for a person who has been at risk for gonorrhea to tell whether they’re infected is to be tested. Gonorrhea can be diagnosed through a urine test or by taking a specimen from the infected area. If left untreated, gonorrhea can cause complications such as PID and infertility.
Yearly gonorrhea testing is recommended for all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Using latex condoms from the very beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact reduces the risk of transmission of gonorrhea.
FAQs
What is gonorrhea?Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), also known as “the clap.” It is a curable infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoea. The bacteria targets the cells of the mucous membranes including:
the surfaces of the urethra, vagina, cervix and endometrium
the fallopian tubes
the anus and rectum
the lining of the eyelid
the throat
How is it transmitted?
Gonorrhea is passed during vaginal sex, oral sex (performing or receiving), or anal sex. It can be passed when the mucous membrane, the soft skin covering all the openings of the body, comes into contact with the mucous membrane secretions or semen of an infected person.
Gonorrhea can be passed even if the penis or tongue does not go all the way into the vagina or anus. If the vagina, cervix, anus, penis or mouth come in contact with infected secretions or fluids; then transmission is possible.
Even a woman who has not had anal sex can get gonorrhea in the anus or rectum if bacteria are spread from the vaginal area, such as when wiping with toilet paper.
Eye infections in adults may result when discharge caries the disease into the eye during sex or hand-to-eye contact.
It can also be passed from mother to newborn as the baby passes through the infected birth canal. This can result in eye infections, pneumonia or other complications
Gonorrhea is not passed through things like shaking hands or toilet seats.
In children, gonorrhea may be a possible sign of sexual abuse.
What are the symptoms?Many men exhibit symptoms within two days to five days after exposure, with a possible range of one to 30 days. Although most women infected will remain asymptomatic (without symptoms), women who develop symptoms will do so within 10 days of infection.
Men may be asymptomatic (without symptoms) but might experience:
Yellowish-white discharge from the penis
Burning or pain when urinating
Urinating more often than usual
Pain or swelling of the testicles
Women are usually asymptomatic (without symptoms) but might experience:
Abnormal discharge from the vagina that is yellow and sometimes bloody.
Burning or pain when urinating
When the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes, some women still have no signs or symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms, which can be an indication that the infection has progressed to pelvic inflammatory disease: lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, pain during intercourse, bleeding between menstrual periods, nausea, fever
Both men and women might have rectal or anal infection. Symptoms are usually not present in about 90% of cases. When present, symptoms include anal or rectal itching, discharge, and pain during defecation.
Gonorrhea infections of the mouth and throat are usually without symptoms. If present, symptoms include soreness and redness in the mouth or throat. A culture test is used to determine if gonorrhea is causing these symptoms.
If gonorrhea infects the eye, men and women might experience conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelid lining). Symptoms of conjunctivitis include redness, itching, and discharge from the eye.
The most common symptoms in newborns include conjunctivitis and pneumonia, which usually develop 5 to 12 days after birth.
How is gonorrhea diagnosed?There are several different testing options for gonorrhea such as urine or swab tests. It may be helpful to speak to your health care provider about what testing options they have available.
People infected with gonorrhea are often also infected with chlamydia; therefore, in patients with gonorrhea treatment is often prescribed for chlamydia as well, since the cost of the treatment is less than the cost of testing for chlamydia. According to the 2002 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, health care providers do not need to consider re-testing patients after treatment unless the patient still has symptoms or if reinfection is suspected.
How is gonorrhea treated?There are antibiotic treatments that are effective in treating gonorrhea. Some strains of gonorrhea have been found to be resistant to certain drugs (known as antimicrobial resistance), so the recommended treatment for most cases involves two antibiotics: one delivered as an injection and the other as an oral medication (usually just a single pill).
Patients with gonorrhea should also be treated for chlamydia (unless testing has ruled out chlamydia infection).
Here are some important points about treatment:
All medications should be taken as directed.
All partners should be examined and treated.
Sexual contact should be avoided until the patient and all partner(s) have been treated and cured.
Persons with symptoms after treatment should be tested again by culture.
Persons who were treated with a non-recommended course of antibiotics (sometimes done if a patient is allergic or the drugs are unavailable) should also be tested again one week after treatment, even if they have no symptoms.
Infections detected after treatment with the recommended medications more commonly occur because of reinfection rather than treatment failure.
What does it mean for my health?If untreated, gonorrhea can cause complications in men, women and infants. Untreated gonorrhea infections in men may lead to:
Prostatitis: inflammation of the prostate gland
Scarring of the urethra, which can cause a narrowing or closing of the urethra
Infertility
Epididymitis: inflammation of the epididymis, the elongated, sperm-carrying, cord-like structure along the posterior border of the testes
Untreated gonorrhea infections in women may lead to:
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID can develop from several days to several months after infection with gonorrhea. Left untreated, PID can cause infertility.
Chronic menstrual difficulties
Postpartum endometritis: inflammation of the lining of the uterus after childbirth
Miscarriage
Cystitis: inflammation of the urinary bladder
Mucopurulent cervicitis: characterized by a yellow discharge from the cervix.
About 1% of men or women with gonorrhea may develop Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI), which is sometimes called gonococcal arthritis. DGI occurs when gonorrhea infection spreads to sites other than genitals, such as the blood, skin, heart, or joints.
Symptoms of DGI include fever, multiple skin lesions, painful swelling of joints (arthritis), infection of the inner lining of the heart, and inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Symptoms of DGI in infants include arthritis, meningitis and sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood
DGI can be successfully treated using antibiotic regimens similar to those recommended for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea.
Gonorrhea can be passed from mother to newborn as the baby passes through the infected birth canal. Complications in infants include: blindness, from untreated eye infections.
How can I reduce my risk?
Abstinence (not having sex) is a sure way to eliminate risk of infection.
Mutual monogamy (having sex with only one uninfected partner) is another way to eliminate risk.
Water-based spermicides are not recommended for the prevention of gonorrhea. Recent studies have shown that nonoxynol-9 (“N-9”), which is found in most water-based spermicides, is not effective in preventing gonorrhea.
Using latex condoms for vaginal and anal sex will reduce risk.
Since gonorrhea can be transmitted even if the penis or tongue does not completely enter the vagina, mouth or rectum, using latex condoms at the beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact is the best form of prevention.
Several barrier methods can be used to reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea during oral sex. A non-lubricated condom can be used for mouth-to-penis contact. Household plastic wrap, a dental dam, or a latex condom cut-up and opened flat can reduce the risk of transmission during mouth-to-vulva/vagina or oral-anal (rimming) contact.
How do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard, but keep in mind that most people with an STD don’t know they have it. It’s important that you talk to your partner as soon as possible so she or he can get treatment. It is possible to pass gonorrhea back and forth, so if you get treated and your partner doesn’t, you may get infected again.

Search this websiteHepatitis
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by a group of viruses. There are five major types of viral hepatitis: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are the most common types of viral hepatitis found in the United States.
Hepatitis A
The hepatitis A virus can enter a person’s body when he or she eats or drinks something contaminated with the stool or blood of someone who has the disease. Symptoms usually appear suddenly, but are not followed by the chronic (long-lasting) problems that hepatitis B and C viruses can cause.
Hepatitis B
The hepatitis B virus can infect a person if his or her mucous membranes or blood are exposed to an infected person’s blood, saliva, semen, or vaginal secretions.
Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is spread by contact with the blood of an infected person. Symptoms appear more gradually than in hepatitis A. Unlike hepatitis A, the hepatitis B and C viruses can stay in the body–sometimes for a lifetime–and eventually cause chronic, serious liver diseases.
When hepatitis viruses damage liver cells, scar tissue is formed and those cells can no longer function. With fewer healthy liver cells, the body begins to show symptoms ranging from mild (such as fatigue) to more severe symptoms (such as mental confusion).
Although many cases of hepatitis are not a serious threat to health, the disease can sometimes become chronic (long-lasting) and may lead to liver failure and death. In many cases, though, viral hepatitis is a self-resolving illness.
Sexual activity poses a different level of risk for each type of viral hepatitis, but is most closely associated with hepatitis B. Blood transfusion, IV needle sharing, and organ transplants may also pose a risk for transmission.
Hepatitis A and B are preventable through vaccination, though no vaccination currently exists for hepatitis C or E. Since hepatitis D only infects persons with active hepatitis B, the vaccine for hepatitis B prevents hepatitis D.

Hepatitis for Men
en who have sex with men (MSM), compared the population as a whole, are at increased risk of getting hepatitis A and B. However, there are safe and effective vaccines available for both hepatitis A and B. Learn more about hepatitis risks and prevention, take a risk assessment and take a quiz to check your knowledge at ASHA’s hepatitis website for men.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—The federal public health agency serving as the center for preventing, tracking, controlling and investigating the epidemiology of AIDS and other diseases.
Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

July 6, 2017
In a 2001 poll by the Pew Research Center—a nonpartisan organization that conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, and other empirical social science research—Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a margin of 57% to 35%. Polling in 2017 shows a significant change in those numbers, with 62% expressing support for same-sex marriage versus 32% opposed. This most recent poll also marked the first time that a majority of those in specific demographic groups, including Baby Boomers, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, did not oppose same-sex marriage.
Check out the Pew Research Center site for an interactive look at the changing views on same-sex marriage.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.

Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.

Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.

Endowment Fund
A gift toward ASHA’s endowment helps ensure that the American Sexual Health Association can provide services to the current as well as future generations. Donors can establish a named endowment with an investment of $10,000. This is a wonderful way to create your own legacy or to honor your family or a family member and ensure the continued excellence of ASHA’s programs and services.
Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form. The stock powers should be signed and the signature guaranteed by your local bank or broker. Mail the stock powers, along with a letter indicating your intent to make a gift, to the address below. Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.

Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.

CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.

Want to take charge of your reproductive health? First, know your own body and advocate for your health. Next, be on the same page with your sexual partners. Both of these aspects of reproductive health must be taken seriously and considered holistically to protect your fertility and health.
Individual Health
You can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person’s ability to conceive a child and a woman’s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation… You will be able to:
Choose if and when you want to conceive a child
Biologically conceive a child
(For women) Deliver a healthy infant
Most people don’t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.
What women need to know
STIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman’s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn
Click here to learn more about chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Genital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It’s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn’t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn’t usually interfere with a woman’s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.
Click here to learn more about herpes.
HIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.
Click here to learn more about HIV.
What men need to know
When STDs/STIs go undetected and untreated, they can have an impact on your fertility. For example:
Chlamydia: For every 100,000 men, 190 will have chlamydia. While rare, infection sometimes spreads to the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm from the testis), causing pain, fever, and, rarely, sterility.
Click here to learn more about chlamydia.
Gonorrhea: For every 100,000 men, 114 will have gonorrhea. Gonorrhea can cause sterility if left untreated.
Click here to learn more about gonorrhea.
HPV: HPV infection resulting in penile or anal cancers are rare, although gay and bisexual men are 17 times more likely to develop anal cancer than heterosexual men.
What you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:
Use condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.
Limit the number of sexual partners you have.
Get an annual physical.
Get tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex)!
Recognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.
Click here to learn more about HPV.
Contraceptive Choices
There are many options available for preventing pregnancy, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. If you are sexually active and don’t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available. You can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that’s best for you.
Communication
In addition to knowing all of this information yourself, it is incredibly important for you to know this information about your partner(s). You have a responsibility to have conversations with your partner(s) about his or her reproductive health in order to protect yourself from infection. The cornerstone of healthy sexual relationships is communication about STIs, consent, fertility, and sexual expectations. Having these conversations will lead to positive, healthier outcomes and a more fun sexual experience with your partner

“When a person is newly diagnosed, they can become overwhelmed with misleading information. Managing Herpes provides a clear overview of the herpes virus, the risks, the treatment options and preventative measures. If you are looking for a resource that explains herpes, this is it!”
–Edward W. Hook, III, MD
More reviews from Amazon
“This is a must read for anyone looking for answers to the most frequently asked questions about HSV. The text is very informative, easy to read and understand.”
“This is good reference book for healthcare providers who dx and treat people with Herpes 2 (HSV2). I diagnose at least 2-3 new cases of HSV2 a week. My patients feel devastated by this initial diagnosis. My main resource is the CDC STD Tx Guidelines 2010 that provides the gold standard for medical/clinical treatment recommendations. I was looking for a resource that presented living with HSV on a more personal/emotional level. This book present the clinical and the emotional sides living with HSV2. I highly recommend this book to all health care providers and their patients.”

HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids, or breast milk of an HIV-infected person.
Over time, infection with HIV can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. These infections are usually controlled by a healthy immune system, but they can cause problems or even be life-threatening in someone with AIDS.
A blood test can determine if a person is infected with HIV. Too many people don’t know they have HIV. In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and almost one in five don’t know they are infected. Getting tested is the first step to finding out if you have HIV. If you have HIV, getting medical care and taking medicines regularly helps you live a longer, healthier life and also lowers the chances of passing HIV on to others.
If a person tests positive for HIV, it does not necessarily mean that the person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition. A person infected with HIV may receive an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. A person with HIV can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses.
FAQs
Where did HIV come from?There are many theories about the origin of HIV. The first known case was found in a blood sample collected from man from Kinshasha, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. Genetic analysis of this blood suggests that the origin of HIV came from a single strain of HIV-1 in the 1940s or 1950s. In the U.S. the virus is known to have existed since the mid 1970s. Symptoms of rare types of what are now known as opportunistic infections began manifesting themselves between 1979-1981. HIV was first isolated by scientists in 1983. The virus was at first called HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
What is AIDS?A diagnosis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is made by a physician. An HIV-infected person may be diagnosed with AIDS if he or she meets certain clinical criteria. Criteria include becoming sick with an illness defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an AIDS-indicator illness (illnesses that take advantage of the body’s weakened immune system) and/or by taking a blood test that shows that the person’s immune system is severely damaged.
What are the symptoms of HIV?Most people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected, because they do not feel ill immediately after infection. However, some people do experience a illness with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes. If an immune reaction to HIV occurs, it usually takes place between 1 and 6 weeks after HIV infection has happened. A person with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you, especially during the initial infection period. You cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. The only way to determine whether HIV is present in a person’s body is by testing.
How does HIV become AIDS?AIDS is a disease caused by HIV. HIV infects cells of the human immune system and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus leads to slow destruction of a persons’ immune system making them more susceptible to many kinds of infections. Once a person with HIV develops any one of a number of rare infections or cancers – tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiases or tumors – they are said to have AIDS. This most often occurs 10-15 years after a person becomes infected with HIV.
How long does it take for HIV to cause AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prior to 1996, scientists estimated that about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years after becoming infected. This time varied greatly from person to person and depended on many factors, including a person’s health status and their health-related behaviors.
Since 1996, the introduction of powerful anti-retroviral therapies has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. There are also other medical treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, though the treatments do not cure AIDS itself. Because of these advances in drug therapies and other medical treatments, estimates of how many people will develop AIDS and how soon are being recalculated, revised, or are currently under study.
How common are HIV and AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 million persons in the United States are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. CDC estimates there are over 41,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year.
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that, since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 60 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes. UNAIDS estimates that about 33.4 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2008.
Who does HIV affect?There are various risk factors that make some people more at risk for contracting HIV than others. Most people, however, run some risk of contracting HIV as they share in one or more of the following risk factors:
Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex
Early age of first sexual activity—It is common for youth to engage in sexual activity before receiving information about HIV prevention
Heterosexual sex–Women and minorities are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection
Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)–Stigma and discrimination make it more difficult for MSM to access testing and counseling services
Sexually transmitted infection (STIs)–The presence of other STIs can greatly increase the likelihood of HIV transmission
Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex
Exchange sex for money
Substance abuse—Chronic and intermittent substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors while using. Injection drug users also run the risk of being infected by HIV while sharing unclean needles.
Poverty—Socioeconomic factors can directly and indirectly influence a person’s vulnerability to HIV infection. For many people poverty prevents access to quality health care.
Out-of-school youth—Those that drop out of school are more likely to become sexually active younger and less likely to use condoms and other types of contraception.
Lack of awareness—Many people, particularly youth, don’t recognize the ways in which they are vulnerable to HIV infection, making them more likely to behave in ways that put them at risk.
How safe is the U.S. blood supply?The U.S. blood supply is one of the safest in the world. Infection through blood transfusion and other blood products is rare. Since 1985, the blood supply has been ELISA tested for HIV. According to the CDC, an estimated 1 in 450,000 to 1 in 660,000 donations per year are infectious for HIV but are not detected by current antibody screening tests. In 1995, blood banks also began testing with P24 tests along with ELISA, to detect infection with HIV during this window period. As technology advances, the blood supply will become even safer.
How is HIV transmitted?HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids (semen, preseminal fluid, or vaginal fluid) or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. People can get HIV one of these fluids enters the body by way of the mucous membranes (the soft, moist skin found in any opening of the body) or the bloodstream. The virus can be passed during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with a HIV-infected person. An HIV-infected mother can transmit HIV to her infant during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. People can also become infected with HIV when using injection drugs through sharing needles and other equipment (or works) including cookers and cottons with someone who is infected.
The risk of transmission varies with the type of exposure (e.g. sexual, needle sharing, etc.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a table quantifying the this HIV transmission risk that comes from different types of exposures. See the table and explanation at the CDC website.
How effective are latex condoms at preventing HIV?Studies have been done to test how well latex condoms work for preventing HIV transmission. This research has shown that latex condoms are highly effective at protecting a person from transmitting or becoming infected with the virus. The studies were done on HIV-negative individuals at high-risk for the disease because there partners were HIV-positive. Latex condoms used consistently and correctly were effective 98-100% of the time.
While not having sex or to having sex with a long-term mutually monogamous partner who is not infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is the only way to protect yourself completely, latex condoms used consistently and correctly are highly effective in preventing HIV and many other STIs.
Can I get HIV from casual contact? HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or in the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone’s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-positive person, playing sports with or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by anyone living with HIV. There is no evidence that HIV is spread through kissing. So you should not be fearful of interacting with persons who are living with the disease.

A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.

Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.

Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.

Search this websiteCDC Reports More than Half of Female Homicides Linked to Intimate Partner Violence
July 24, 2017
More than half of all homicides of women in the U.S. are related to intimate partner violence, according to new data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). IPV-related deaths included those involving homicides where the victim was an intimate partner—such as a current or former spouse or girlfriend—of the suspect, as well as other deaths associated with IPV, including victims who were family, friends, first responders, or bystanders.
Researchers from CDC analyzed homicide data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) of 10,018 women aged 18 years or older in 18 states during 2003–2014. Among the key findings:
Over half of female homicides (55.3%) for which circumstances were known were related to IPV.
Young, racial/ethnic minority women are disproportionately affected: About one third of victims (29.4%) were aged 18–29 years, and non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native women had the highest rates of homicide.
Arguments and jealousy were common factors involved in IPV-related homicides.
One in 10 victims of IPV-related homicide reportedly experienced violence in the month before their deaths.
Approximately 15% of victims of reproductive age (18–44 years) were pregnant or postpartum.
The researchers discuss strategies that could help prevent IPV-related homicides, including risk assessments by first responders to IPV-related incidents that can help identify women at greater risk to connect them to local services, state legislation to limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order, and bystander programs, such as Green Dot, that teaches effective intervention skills and violence prevention. They also note that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening women of childbearing age for IPV and referring women who screen positive for intervention services.
The National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7 to talk confidentially with anyone in the United States who is experiencing domestic violence, seeking resources or information, or questioning unhealthy aspects of their relationship. The toll free, 24/7 hotline is available at 1-800-799-7233. Live chat is also available every day from 7 am to 2 am Central time.

And with our grassroots program the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, we also offer that education and support in local communities as well.
Our education efforts extend to specific audiences beyond the general public, including healthcare providers. From the creation of continuing education programs for physicians to the development of resources such as toolkits, videos and apps geared toward providers, ASHA works to ensure that providers can offer the best sexual health care to their patients.
With their ability to reach wide audience, the media are also an important target of ASHA’s outreach. We work with a wide range of media outlets—TV, radio, print media, and popular web outlets—as a sought-after commentator on news and trends in popular culture that touch on sexual health issues, promoting positive coverage that destigmatizes the subject.
Build Alliances
We work with a number of national organizations and that share our goals of promoting sexual health issues in order to strengthen advocacy for sexual health promotion. ASHA is a key member of such entities as the National Sexual Health Coalition, the North American Federation of Sexual Health Organizations, and Cervical Cancer Free America. We also regularly bring together and consult with professionals in the field to promote better understanding and acceptance of the sexual health model.
Advocate
ASHA maintains a policy office in Washington, DC, affirming its long-term commitment to advocacy for systemic change. ASHA’s Washington office works to secure sound policy responses to the sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic in the areas of prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and education through efforts with policymakers and national organizations. ASHA has been successful in obtaining bipartisan support for STI programs and continues to educate policy makers about the economic, social, and public health benefits of appropriate STI policy.
We work in coalition with organizations in family planning, HIV, and women’s health, as well as organizations representing people of color and faith-based groups to keep STIs on the forefront of the policy agenda. ASHA is routinely asked to provide strategy and content advice on sexual health-related issues to a variety of national organizations and also provides leadership on numerous boards and committees.

Search this websiteMGen: The STI You’ve (Probably) Never Heard Of
It’s been associated with urethritis in men and linked to cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. In one study of young men and women, it was found to be more common than gonorrhea infection. But odds are you’ve never been tested for, or even heard of, this sexually transmitted bacterial infection.
So what is it?
Mycoplasma genitalium, or Mgen, was first identified in 1980. It is a bacterium that can infect the reproductive tract and is passed on through sexual contact. In men, infection with Mgen can cause urethritis (swelling and irritation of the urethra), and in women it has been linked to cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix), pelvic inflammatory disease, and possibly infertility.
How common is it?
While there aren’t statistics to show how common infection with Mgen is, in one study of 2,932 young men and women, Mgen was more prevalent that gonorrhea, but less than chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Like those infections, Mgen can be asymptomatic, particularly in women. Women may have pain with urination, vaginal discharge, or discomfort with sex, while men may experience burning, painful urination and sometimes a discharge from the penis.
How do you test for it?
There is no widely available commercial diagnostic test for Mgen. However, labs can use a specific type of test method—nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT)—to identify an Mgen infection. Testing can be done on urine (men and women) or cervical swabs (women).
Can it be treated?
If someone is diagnosed, the infection can be easily treated. Since Mgen is a bacterial infection, it can be cured with antibiotics, typically with a single dose of azithromycin. Occasionally, additional antibiotic treatment is required.

Search this websiteSafer Sex Tools for Relationships
Once you have decided on your own “safer sex” boundaries, you will need to gather the tools you will need to stick to your decisions. Some of the most common “tools” are included below:
Condoms and Other Contraceptives
Currently, condoms are the only widely available, proven method for reducing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during intercourse. ASHA supports the promotion and use of condoms to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently. For more about condom do’s and don’ts click here.
Using a lubricant with condoms makes them both more enjoyable and less likely to break. Click below to see condom options:
Latex male condom
Advantages
Inexpensive
Accessible, the most common type of condom
Available in a variety of colors, textures, thicknesses, and sizes
Malleable and stretchy
Disadvantages
Can NOT be used with oils or oil-based lubes
Will degrade in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
Polyurethane (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Good for those with a latex sensitivity/allergy
Thin, so transmits warmth well
Safe with oil-based lubes
Disadvantages
Does not conform as tightly to a penis, so it may slip off more easily
Not as stretchy as latex, so it may break more easily and may fit a limited range of penis sizes
Polyisoprene (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Good for those with a latex sensitivity
Malleable and stretchy like latex
Disadvantages
Can NOT be used with oil-based lubes
Will degrade (break down) in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
Lambskin (non-latex) male condom
Advantages
Feels “natural”
Good for those with a latex sensitivity (but do not protect against STIs/STDs!)
Disadvantages
DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST STIs/STDs, only pregnancy
Looser fit than latex
Female condom
Female condom, made of polyurethane or nitrile.
Advantages
Outer ring covers a larger surface area, protects more of a woman’s mucous membrane
Good for those with latex sensitivity
A man does not have to pull out as soon as he ejaculates, as he would with male condoms.
Wearer can be in control
Can insert condom up to eight hours before sex
Disadvantages
Some say the outer ring irritates the clitoris and vulva
Expensive
Difficult to find
Cannot be used at the same time as a male condom
Slippage is common
May be uncomfortable for the receiver of anal sex
Male condom options include not just the type of material, but size as well. When it comes to condoms, size does matter. Learn more about condom sizing.
In addition to condoms, there are many other forms of contraceptives that you may choose to use. You can refer to our birth control method comparison chart to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of other forms of birth control.
Lubricant
A good lubricant (lube) is one of the most important tools in your sexual toolkit. Lube reduces friction which can cause tiny tears in the skin, which make it more likely for the person to get an infection if his/her partner has one. Lube can also make sex feel better, whether having intercourse, masturbating, having oral sex, or using sex toys.
In addition, condoms work better and are less likely to tear when you use lube. Lube can also make oral sex with a barrier more enjoyable for the female receiving it.
Women self-lubricate their vaginas when they are turned on, but many factors may reduce lubrication: alcohol or other drugs (including hormonal birth control, stimulants, antihistamines, antidepressants, chemotherapy), monthly hormonal changes, peri-menopause, menopause, breastfeeding, a history of sexual assault, and other psychological and physical factors. Women may want extra lubrication on the vulva and clitoris during sex, as lubrication from the vagina often does not reach these external areas.
The anus does not self-lubricate, and you always need to use a lubricant to prevent the very fragile skin of the anus from tearing during anal play or intercourse. Most people like an anal lubricant thicker than those used for vaginal sex.
NOTE: Avoid any lubricant with lidocaine or benzocaine, which dull the body’s natural defense (pain), which lets you know when something is wrong, including tearing of the skin.
Below are types of lubricants you might choose, with advantages and disadvantages of each:
Saliva
Advantages
Free
Accessible
Disadvantages
Not as slippery as others
May spread infection if the saliva of an infected person is used as the lubricant
Dries up more quickly than others
Oil/petroleum-based lubricants
Includes such lubricants as Vaseline and baby oil.
Advantages
Great for external male masturbation
Inexpensive and accessible
Disadvantages
NOT for vaginal use
NOT for use with latex condoms or toys
Stains fabric
Natural/plant-based oils
Includes coconut, grapeseed, apricot, jojoba, olive oils; Crisco
Advantages
Great for massage
All-natural
Safe to eat
Moisturizing–good for dry skin
Inexpensive and accessible
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Absorbed into the skin
Disadvantages
NOT for use with latex condoms or toys
Stains fabric
Can go rancid
Water-based lubricants
Advantages
Doesn’t stain fabric
Latex-friendly
Some come flavored for oral sex
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Disadvantages
Some ingredients may be irritating for sensitive skin (glycol,parabens, glycerin, flavorings, nonoxodyl-9).
Dries out quickly (Use saliva or water to reconstitute.)
Silicone lubes
Advantages
Latex-friendly
Stays slick in water (i.e. hot tubs)
Stays slippery longer than others
Safe for vaginal and anal use
Disadvantages
Expensive
Stains sheets
NOT to be used with silicone or cyber skin toys
Must be washed off with soap and water
May make surfaces such as floors and showers slippery
Barriers for Oral Sex
Barriers used during oral sex can help prevent transmission of STIs. Options include:
Dental dams (latex)
Advantages
Thicker than plastic wrap, less likely to tear
Disadvantages
Cannot be used with oil or oil-based lubes
Latex will degrade in high heat (wallet, glove compartment)
May be difficult to find
Limited range of sizes
Plastic Wrap
Plastic wrap (a.k.a. cling wrap), non-latex(i.e. Saran Wrap. Use a non-microwavable type.
Advantages
Easily accessible
Inexpensive
Can have exactly the size you want and need
Good for those with latex sensitivity or allergy
Disadvantages
Thinner than dental dams so may tear more easily
Sex toys
Sharing sex toys (like vibrators, for example) can be risky if they have vaginal fluids, blood, or feces on them. Sharing sex toys without cleaning them or using a condom can potentially expose a person to STIs.
The safest practice is not to share sex toys. If sex toys are shared, a condom should be used. With toys that can be inserted into the vagina or anus, a person may put a condom onto the toy. For shared toys in which the penis is inserted, a condom may be worn. It is important to change the condom before another person uses the toy so that any body fluids or infectious organisms on the sex toy are not passed on to the partner. It is also important to change the condom when moving from the anus to the vagina to prevent possible infection.
When cleaning sex toys, look to see what the manufacturer’s instructions recommend. Some may be best cleaned with soap and water, while certain types of may be made from materials, such as silicone, that are dishwasher safe.

Search this websiteTen Questions to Ask
Talking to a healthcare provider about your sexual health can be intimidating. You might feel embarrassed about the questions that you have; you might not want to admit to certain feelings or fears about your health. However, being able to talk to your healthcare provider about your physical health as it relates to your sexual health is absolutely crucial.
If you can’t be totally honest about what’s happening with your body and your feelings about it, you won’t be able to get accurate treatment. Your healthcare provider should be able to give you straightforward, nonjudgmental feedback and advice about your body and sexual life, but he or she has to start with the whole picture!
The first step is to choose a healthcare provider that you trust. They should be someone who is open-minded, honest, and very good at listening. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about your own boundaries in terms of what is okay in terms of how they deal with your body and health concerns.
If you feel uncomfortable with your healthcare provider for any reason, follow your instincts; ask around for other recommendations. Your good health depends on your ability to communicate and rely on your healthcare provider! You might have to try more than one before you feel completely comfortable. But when you do, they  will be an ally as you continue to learn more about how to remain in good health.
When thinking about how to discuss your concerns or sexual problems with your healthcare provider, remember that:
they are there to help you
the things you want to talk about are almost certainly not new.
they  will have dealt with many patients who come to the table with all kinds of questions or conditions.
Ten Questions to Ask
The questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider can cover a wide range of topics. from changes in sex drive, dealing with sex during pregnancy, pain during sex, protecting your fertility, what form of contraception would be best, or other issues. There are few topics, however, that any sexually active person should be sure to discuss, including preventing sexually transmitted infections, getting tested, and more.
The 10 questions below are a great place to start the conversation with your healthcare provider.
I want to make sure that I’m taking all of the right steps to protect myself from sexually transmitted infections. Where should I start?
How can I talk to my partner about STIs? Can you give me some advice?
I want to make sure that my partner and I get tested before we have sex. Where should I go? How can I bring up the topic with him/her?
Given what we’ve talked about in terms of my relationship history, should I be tested for STDs/STIs? Which ones?
How often should I be tested for STIs? Which ones?
Are there any vaccines I should consider to protect myself from STIs? Are there vaccines that are recommended for me?
What are my options when it comes to birth control? How can I talk to my partner about birth control options?
I’ve been feeling differently about sex recently. Can we talk about what might be going on?
What screenings* are recommended for someone my age? (*such as STI tests, mammograms, prostate cancer screening, etc.)
I’m not always happy with the way my partner treats me. Can we chat about that?
Your provider needs to know some personal information about you so that she or he can help answer your questions and assess your risk and offer the correct advice. You may want to talk to your provider about the following:
Your sexual history
Your current sexual practices
Your condom use
Any symptoms you have
If you could be pregnant
Finding the Right Provider
What if you don’t have a regular healthcare provider? Where do you begin trying to find one? You can start by asking family, friends, or co-workers for referrals. If you have health insurance, your insurance company should offer a list of providers as well. The links below offer another resource, allowing you to search for appropriate providers and health centers in your area:
Find a Health Center (from the U.S. Health Resources Services Administration)
Search federally-funded health centers that provide care even if you have no health insurance. You pay what you can afford, based on your income.
MedlinePlus Directories
MedlinePlus (a service of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health) provides links to directories to help you find health professionals, services and facilities.
Planned Parenthood
Find a Planned Parenthood clinic near you.

This is a wonderful way to create your own legacy or to honor your family or a family member and ensure the continued excellence of ASHA’s programs and services.
Matching Gifts
Your gift could be matched dollar for dollar! Many companies offer matching gift programs that will double, even triple, a donation’s value. If you have questions about your company’s matching gift program, please contact your human resources office.
Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form. Please check with your human resource directors for more information.
Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number. If you have questions, please contact Lynn Barclay at 919.361.3125.
Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form. The stock powers should be signed and the signature guaranteed by your local bank or broker. Mail the stock powers, along with a letter indicating your intent to make a gift, to the address below. Under separate cover, send the stock certificate(s) to the same address. For additional protection, we recommend that you send the certificate(s) via registered mail.
Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteSurvey Shows Condom Use Higher among Young People
August 10, 2017
Rates of condom use remained largely unchanged in recent years according to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), with higher usage reported among those ages 15-19.
Using in-person interviews with males and females in the U.S. ages 15-44, the NSFG collects data on topics such as relationships, pregnancy, contraception use, and reproductive health. Key findings from the most recent study include:
During 2011-2015, nearly 24% of men and 34% of women reported using a condom with their most recent experience of sexual intercourse.
Over the last four weeks, 18% of men and 24% of women reported using condoms “100% of the time” with intercourse. 7% of the women in this group said the condom “broke or completely fell off.”
The majority of condom users – 60% of men and 56% of women – used condoms as their sole method of contraception.
Dennis Fortenberry, MD, MS, a professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said “Although condoms will never solve all of the STI and pregnancy prevention needs of a diverse population, they remain an accessible and low-cost technology necessary for comprehensive public health prevention approaches.”
Fortenberry notes the overall proportion of condom use is stable in recent years, with no large changes across the U.S. population. He says condom use is “quite high among younger sexually active populations where STI and pregnancy are important and access to other means of prevention may be limited.” The NSFG report confirms condom use is higher among young people: among those ages 15-19, 36% of women and 53% of men said they used condoms each time they had sex over the past year, compared to 11% of men and 9% of women ages 35-44.
Responding to issues with slippage and breakage, Fortenberry says we can do more to teach people how to use condoms correctly: “The relatively high frequency of condom use problems suggests the need for continued public health education and training, since other research suggests that problems are less frequent among more experienced users.”
ASHA’s resources on condoms (such as how to use them correctly) include the Condomology initiative with fact sheets, videos, and more.

Volunteer Spotlight
NJ Chapter Leader Sandy Fischer, second from left, and chapter volunteers gear up for the chapter’s annual Halloween 5K.
Sandy Cowan Fischer, current chapter leader of the NCCC New Jersey Chapter in Montclair, has worked tirelessly to help spread awareness about cervical cancer prevention and the importance of early detection. The New Jersey Chapter was originally founded by Cristina Lucchetti Ryan in memory of her best friend, CaryAnne Cowan, a mother and life-long New Jersey resident who lost her life to cervical cancer in 2007. CaryAnne’s sister Sandy became involved with the New Jersey Chapter in 2009 and as chapter leader has done incredible work to raise awareness and spread the word about cervical cancer prevention. The New Jersey Chapter’s signature event, its annual 5K Halloween fundraiser, has helped the chapter raise funds to promote its educational efforts and, most significantly, allowed the chapter to award $5,000 to a local health center to support free Pap tests for women in need.
Thank you, Sandy, and all of the NJ Chapter volunteers for your efforts to prevent cervical cancer and save lives!

The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term.

Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.

CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

By the age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections. That’s more than 9 million youth with a sexually transmitted infection.
Young people aged 15-24 represent only a quarter of the sexually active population. Yet they have almost half of all sexually transmitted infections (STIs) out there! Let’s take a look at which sexually transmitted infections affect youth most.
Young people aged 15-19 account for 40% of chlamydia cases.
One in five young people will become infected with genital herpes by the time they reach adulthood.
Males 20-24 have the highest rates of gonorrhea.
Why is it that STDs/STIs continue to be a problem among young people? It is not a question as to whether teenagers are having sex. By twelfth grade, 65% of high school students will have engaged in sexual intercourse, and one in five sexually active teens will have had four or more sexual partners. These numbers continue to rise after high school. With this, chronic STIs are more likely to be transmitted to future partners and spread throughout populations. Teenagers and young adults are a vulnerable population because they make decisions and act in ways that put them at greater risk for STIs.
Young people are more likely than any other age group to:
Have multiple sex partners
Engage in unprotected sex
Use drugs and alcohol at high rates
Engage in high risk behaviors while under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol
Although STIs can be scary and embarrassing at times, they are not uncommon. Click here to learn ways to stay healthy and to protect against STIs.
Talking to Your Healthcare Provider
You should be talking to your healthcare provider about how to be sexually healthy and make sure that you understand how to protect yourself from STIs as effectively as possible.
Be sure to get tested for STIs on a regular basis especially whenever you are sexually active with a new partner. Many STIs do not have physical symptoms, and it’s crucial that you know your status so that you can take steps to treat your body if you do suffer from an infection–and so that you can protect your partner.
Remember, your healthcare provider is here to help you maintain good health in all areas of your life, so be sure to be completely honest about your concerns and experiences. This will help your healthcare provider have a full, clear picture of your health as a whole, because good sexual health and good general health go hand in hand.
Here are some conversation openers that may be helpful:
“When I do decide to have sex, I want to make sure that I’m taking all of the right steps to protect myself from STIs. Where should I start?”
[If you have a female partner] “How can I talk with my partner about birth control?”
“How can I talk to my partner about STDs/STIs? Can you give me some advice?”
“I want to make sure that my partner and I get tested before we have sex for the first time. Where should I go? How should I bring up the topic with him/her?”

A Guy’s Guide When His Partner is Diagnosed with HPV
HPV, abnormal Pap tests, follow-up exams and treatments are confusing for the women dealing with them, but what about the boyfriends and husbands?

September 12, 2017
A new report from the Guttmacher Institute reveals that rates of adolescent pregnancy, birth and abortion in the United States reached historic lows in 2013.
The decline among teens specifically is striking: the U.S. pregnancy rate among 15–19-year-olds was at its lowest point in at least 80 years and had dropped to just above one-third of a recent peak rate in 1990.
As the lead author of the report Kathryn Kost noted in a news release, “These new estimates affirm that long-term declines in adolescent pregnancies, births and abortions have continued. The available evidence suggests that improved contraceptive use continues to be the primary driver of these declines.” Indeed, the report discusses recent research showing significant increases in the use of contraceptives in young women, including
the use of multiple methods and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods.
Read the full report at Guttmacher.

Search this websiteConsent and Sexual Assault
What is consent?
Consent is an agreement that is willfully given without any external pressure or factors. Communication is key, boundaries should be established before, during, and after sexual activity. In order for someone to consent to sexual activity participants must continuously communicate before, during, and after sexual activity- this is the only way to establish clear boundaries between participants and allows for a relaxing experience.
Consent does not always have to be verbal, but discussing boundaries, expectations, and consent between participants at each sexual encounter is the best way to avoid confusion and respect boundaries.
Consent must be given
Voluntarily and without coercion Consent must be freely given. External factors such as pressure, threat, or physical violence invalidate a verbal “yes” or a silent “no.”
Sober Someone who has had too much to drink cannot consent to sexual activity. In addition, someone who is unconscious- whether from substances or simply napping- cannot consent to sexual activity.
Continuously Consent must be given with every sexual act. Just because someone consented to sexual activity once does not mean consent will be given every time. Even if someone has consented 100 times it does not mean they will consent the 101st. Consent may be given at the beginning of sex but then taken back. You MUST stop sexual activity. Even if consent is given at the beginning of a sexual act it can be taken back at anytime! Everyone has agency over his or her own body and respect of one another is SO important.
With confidence and enthusiasm Consent must be given with confidence and enthusiasm. If you or a partner is reluctant about intensifying sexual encounters then instead of advancing you should have a conversation and communicate about your comfort levels.
InformedIn order for someone to consent to sex each participant must be informed and say yes to each sexual act that is performed. This is important to realize as the term “hook up” may mean sexual intercourse to one party but may mean basic kissing to another. With this, someone may originally consent to a “hook up” but rescind consent midway through because of a miscommunication. This must be respected! In addition, informed consent means both partners are aware of each others’ STI status, in agreement of the methods of birth control being used, and comfortable with the environment in which they are having sex. Basically, informed consent means that there are no surprises and consent can be rescinded at any point—especially under changing conditions!
Sexual Coercion
Sexual coercion is when someone pressures, uses drugs or alcohol, or forces sexual contact with a person against his or her will.
Examples of Sexual Coercion include
When a person persistently attempts to have sexual contact with someone after refusal.
When a person makes another feel like he or she owes them sexual contact. (Ex. “ But I bought dinner…” “We have been together for so long…” “I have been waiting all day for this…” “You’ve already gotten me turned on.”)
When a person gives excessive, insincere compliments to get another to agree to sexual contact. (Ex.“You’re so sexy I can’t control myself around you.” “I’ve thought about it and I think you would look so good naked”)
When someone badgers, yells, or holds a person down to have sexual contact
When someone gives, or persistently encourages the use of, drugs or alcohol to loosen someone up. (Ex: “Let’s liquor you up.”)
When someone pressures or threatens another to agree to sexual contact because they are in a relationship (Ex: “If you love me, you would do this.” “If you don’t have sex with me I will just go find someone who will.”)
When someone reacts with sadness or anger when another says no. (Ex: “If you don’t have sex with me you don’t love me.”  “You’re a slut so what’s your problem with me?”)
When someone continues to pressure another when he or she says no. (Ex: “I am just going to tell everyone we had sex anyway so we may as well.”)
When someone claims they “need it” or normalizes expectations. (Ex. “Guys just need it.” “You’re going to give me blue balls.”)
Sexual Assault
Sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that happens without explicit consent of the victim.
Examples of sexual assault include
Attempted rape
Fondling or unwanted sexual touching
Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts on the perpetrator
Forcible sodomy: anal or oral sex against a person’s will
Forcible object penetration: penetrating someone’s vagina or anus, or causing that person to penetrate her or himself, against that person’s will
Rape: penetration of the victim’s body
Incest

Taking care of young people is often a challenge, since they often do not visit their healthcare provider on a regular basis (especially boys and young men). These tools – companion pieces to age-specific self-assessments for young males and females – are meant to trigger questions you may want to ask, even for patients in the office for a simple sports physical. ASHA’s goal is that every provider visit involves these important topics.
The tools were developed through a number of activities, including a literature review and research with the target audiences. As a healthcare provider you have power as well.
The checklist for healthcare providers (female patients ages 9-young adult)
The checklist for healthcare providers (male patients ages 10-18
A patient self-assessment tool for females ages 9-14.
A patient self-assessment tool for males ages 10-13.
A patient self-assessment tool for females ages 15-young adult.
A patient self-assessment tool for males ages 14-18.
These tools were developed by the American Sexual Health Association, School-Based Health Alliance, Healthy Teen Network, and Partnership for Male Youth, through an independent educational grant from Merck and Company.
Treating Adolescent Male Patients: An Interview with Dr. David Bell
To explore issues related to the examination of the young male patient, ASHA had a conversation with Dr. David Bell for our Sex+Health podcast. Dr Bell discusses ways to build rapport with patients, elements of the physical examination, immunizations, sexual health, and other matters of relevance to this population. Dr. Bell is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Population and Family Health at the Columbia University Medical Center. He is also the Medical Director of The Young Men’s Clinic at the New York Presbyterian Hospital.
A 16-Year-Old Boy in the Clinic for a Sports Physical
CME/CE Credit for Physicians and Nurses
In collaboration with WebMD and The Yellow Umbrella Organization, ASHA has developed an activity, A 16-Year-Old Boy in the Clinic for a Sports Physical, for pediatricians, nurses, and primary care physicians. The goal is to reinforce knowledge of the indications for HPV vaccination in males. See more here.
An 11-Year-Old Girl Due for Vaccinations
CME/CE Credit for Physicians and Nurses
Also in collaboration with WebMD and The Yellow Umbrella Organization, ASHA has developed an activity, An 11-Year-Old Girl Due for Vaccinations, for pediatricians, nurses, obstetricians and gynecologists, and primary care physicians. The goal is to provide guidance on responding to human papillomavirus (HPV)-vaccine-hesitant parents.
The Importance of Talking to Adolescent Patients about Sexual Health
A new CDC report on the drop in teen sex rates over the past 25 years has been covered by many outlets as a marked decrease. The facts however, offer a different story. Forty-four percent of female teens and 47 percent of male teens report ever having had sex, and by age 19 nearly 70 percent of teens have done so. These numbers have remained steady since 2002. They represent millions of teens that need education and skills to help them protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
As the CDC report and the No Child Left Behind reauthorization’s restrictions on sex education in schools reignites debate about comprehensive sex education, healthcare providers may be the only trusted source for a young male to get the facts.
In a recent interview, former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, PhD, likened abstinence-only education to the Tuskegee experiments, stating, “I think abstinence-only programs are really unfair . . . . What is it that justifies educating people about their bodies and leaving out things that have to deal with human sexuality? Before I was Surgeon General I had the opportunity to get President Clinton to apologize for the Tuskegee study…[T]hese black men were denied information and access to care…and now we’re talking about denying young people information that they can use to protect themselves if they decide to become sexually active.”
Take the time to talk to your young patients and let them talk to you. We ask that you take every opportunity to teach that health is indeed power!

Sexuality
Understanding what all the letters stand for in LGBTQ might be a bit confusing. Over time, letters are added and removed to represent an increased awareness and acceptance of sexuality and gender.
LGBQ – All refer to sexuality. This list is by no means exhaustive and ASHA makes no attempt to restrict how individuals define their sexuality.
L – Lesbian: Generally refers to a female identified person who is attracted to other female identified people.
B – Bisexual(bi): An individual of any gender who is attracted to both female and male identified individuals
Q – Queer: A person who does is not exclusively attracted to people of the opposite sex but does not subscribe to restrictive labeling
G- Gay: Generally refers to a male identified person who is attracted to other male identified people.
Gender Identity
Gender Identity = how we choose to identify our gender. Common gender identities are male, female, transgender, nonbinary
T- Transgender (Trans)
While the trans community is often associated with LGBQ it is important to understand that gender should not automatically be connected to sexuality.
Transgender is term that typically describes individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, someone might be born with female genitalia but identify as male.
To learn more about the trans community and how to support it visit the National Center for Transgender Equality.
For trans organizations, legal resources, crisis centers and other resources check out GLAAD’s Resource Center.
Want to be more inclusive? Here are some easy changes to get started.
Pronouns. Likely, you have seen people who have their pronouns listed in their email signature or bio.
Some common pronouns are she/her/hers, he/him/his and they/them/theirs
Adopting pronouns for your group can make gender nonconforming folks feel more comfortable.
Not sure what someone’s pronouns are? It is always better to ask then make a wrong assumption.
Be affirming. If someone tells you that they are gay/bi/trans/queer/etc, the best thing that you can do is be supportive.
Responses that are not helpful: Man, you can totally pass for straight. I have always wanted a gay best friend.
It is okay to ask questions but remember. People have to come out over and over again, it’s exhausting. They might not want to talk about it.
Use neutral language. This is a very simple way to be inclusive. Instead of saying.
I am glad you are coming to dinner, is your husband coming? Try instead. I am glad you are coming to dinner, is your spouse coming? You could also say “Is your partner coming?”
It is such a small thing that can people make people feel included and like they do not have to constantly explain themselves
Never out someone else. Unless you are 100% confident that someone is out, do not share that information for anyone. Typically, “coming out” or “being out” refer to disclosing your status as not hetereosexual. The process of coming out is highly personal and should always be left up to the individual.
It is not up to you to decide if someone is open about their sexuality or gender identity
Be an advocate
Members of the LGBT community experience violence at higher rates, especially trans women of color
44 percent of lesbians and 61 percent of bisexual women experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner
26 percent of gay men and 37 percent of bisexual men experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner
The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that 47% of transgender people are sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime.

Search this websiteMolluscum
Molluscum contagiosum is a skin disease caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) that usually causes one or more small lesions/bumps. Molluscum is generally a benign infection and symptoms may self-resolve. While once a disease primarily of children, molluscum has evolved to become a sexually transmitted disease in adults. It is believed to be a member of the pox virus family.
FAQS
How is molluscum transmitted?Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) may be sexually transmitted by skin-to-skin contact (does not have to be mucous membranes) and/or lesions. Transmission through sexual contact is the most common form of transmission for adults.
MCV may be transmitted from inanimate objects such as towels and clothing that come in contact with the lesions. MCV transmission has been associated with swimming pools and sharing baths with an infected person.
MCV also may be transmitted by autoinoculation, such as touching a lesion and touching another part of the body. To stop from further spreading the infection, do not shave over or close to areas that are visibly infected.
What is the incubation period?The incubation period averages 2 to 3 months and may range from 1 week to 6 months.
How long are you infectious?This is not known for certain, but researchers assume that if the virus is present it may be transmitted.
What are the symptoms?
Lesions are usually present on the thighs, buttocks, groin and lower abdomen of adults, and may occasionally appear on the external genital and anal region.
Children typically develop lesions on the face, trunk, legs and arms.
The lesions may begin as small bumps which can develop over a period of several weeks into larger sores/bumps. The lesions can be flesh colored, gray-white, yellow or pink. They can cause itching or tenderness in the area, but in most cases the lesions cause few problems. Lesions can last from 2 weeks to 4 years—the average is 2 years.
People with AIDS or others with compromised immune systems may develop extensive outbreaks.
How is it diagnosed?Diagnosis is usually made by the characteristic appearance of the lesion. MCV may be diagnosed by collecting a specimen from the lesion, placing it onto a slide and staining with a Gram stain which shows changes in infected cells. Diagnosis may be made by collecting a specimen from the lesion and viewing it under an electron microscope.
How is it treated?
Most symptoms are self-resolving, but generally lesions are removed. Removal of lesions reduces autoinoculation and transmission to others.
Lesions can be removed surgically and/or treated with a chemical agent such as podophyllin, cantharidin, phenol, silver nitrate, trichloracetic acid or iodine.
Cryotherapy is an alternative method of removal.
Lesions may recur, but it is not clear whether this is due to reinfection, exacerbation of subclinical infection, or reactivation of latent infection.
What does it mean for my health?In people with HIV infection, molluscum contagiosum is often a progressive disease.
How can I reduce my risk?
Because transmission through sexual contact is the most common form of transmission for adults, preventing skin-to-skin contact with an infected partner will be most effective in preventing MCV.
Latex condoms or other moisture barriers for vaginal, oral, and anal sex may help to prevent such contact. Limitations of such barriers must be recognized as MCV does NOT require mucous membrane contact to be passed.
Using spermicides is not recommended as they can irritate the skin or vaginal tissue and, especially for women, cause abrasions (tiny openings in skin) that may make it easier to contract STDs/STIs.
Using condoms may protect the penis or vagina from infection, but do not protect from contact with other areas such as the scrotum or anal area.
Mutual monogamy (sex with only one uninfected partner)
If you do get molluscum contagiosum, avoid touching the lesion and then touching another part of the body without washing your hands to prevent any chance of spreading the infection.

It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

Search this websiteNew CDC Data Show that STD Rates Continue to Rise
August 29, 2018
New data released today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal that STD rates continue to climb in the U.S., with nearly 2.3 million cases reported to CDC. The data on five year trends in reported STDs show that increases in STDs have continued for four consecutive years. From 2013-2017:
Syphilis cases nearly doubled
Gonorrhea cases increased by 67%
Chlamydia remained at record highs
As Gail Bolan, MD, Director of the Division of STD Prevention at CDC commented, “After decades of declining STDs, in recent years, we’ve been sliding backwards. In addition to these sharp increases, we’re also facing new challenges that we must address like the potential link between STD risk and drug use and the ongoing threat that gonorrhea will eventually wear down our last highly effective antibiotic.”
While striking, the data on reported STDs is only part of the story. Many cases go undiagnosed and untreated, and the consequences of untreated infections can be severe. While chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are curable with antibiotics, complications of untreated infection include infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth in infants, and increased HIV risk.
Also important to note is the fact that STDs impact some groups more than others. Men who have sex with men (MSM) made up almost 70 percent of primary and secondary syphilis, and young women 15-24 made up about 45 percent of the 1.7 million reported cases of chlamydia.
In a press briefing announcing the release of the new data, Bolan noted the importance of following CDC’s recommendations for screening. As she stated, “We recommend that all sexually active women less than the age of 25 go in and get checked for chlamydia and gonorrhea on an annual basis. We recommend that men who are having sex with men, go in and get checked at least annually for sexually transmitted diseases…We just need to get our providers doing sexual histories and doing the appropriate screening and we need to have clients who come in and access care to be asking, do I need to be – everyone needs to ask their doctor, should I be tested for STDs, I hear they’re going up. So, have that conversation.”

Search this websiteInternal Condoms
The internal condom, also called a female condom, offers women the advantage of a form of contraception and STI prevention that she can control. A female (or internal) condom is a pouch that’s inserted in the vagina or anus before sex  to protect against sexually transmitted infection and pregnancy.Due to it’s outer ring, the internal condom also offers better protection from herpes and HPV which can be spread from skin to skin contact.
What is it?
The internal condom is a nitrile pouch that fits inside a woman’s vagina. It has a soft ring on each end. The outer, larger ring stays on the outside of the vagina and partly covers the labia (lips). The inner ring fits on the inside of the vagina, somewhat like a diaphragm, to hold the condom in place. The internal condom can also be used in the rectum for anal sex.
The internal condom should be inserted before the penis touches the vagina. It can be inserted anywhere from immediately before to up to 8 hours prior to intercourse–allowing time to plan ahead. Another advantage of the female condom—it stays in place whether or not a male partner maintains an erection.
How to Use It
To start, add lubricant to the outside of the condom. To insert the condom, squeeze the inner ring of the condom and put the inner ring and pouch inside the vagina.
With your finger, push the inner ring as far into the vagina as it will go. The outer ring stays outside the vagina. Guide the penis into the condom, taking care that the penis is inserted into the condom and doesn’t push the condom aside.
After intercourse, the condom should be removed before standing up. Twist the outside ring and pull the condom out gently, making sure not to spill the contents. Condoms should not be reused, so throw away the condom (but don’t flush it!)
Anal Sex
The internal condom can also be used for anal sex. You can either leave the inside ring in or take it out based on your preference. Put the condom over the penis or toy and slowly insert into the rectum. Remove the condom in the same way mentioned above.

Experts say we can only meet sexual health challenges by shifting away from the current focus on diseases and moving towards a perspective that promotes health and wellness. In a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Viewpoint published online June 18, 2015, Sexual Health in America: Improving Patient Care and Public Health, former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, PhD, former ASHA Board Chair Edward W. Hook III, MD, and current ASHA Board member Eli Coleman, PhD, say we can move towards solutions by embracing a comprehensive sexual health framework that looks towards the promotion of health and wellness rather than a narrow fixation on diseases. Read the Viewpoint here.
While talking to patients about sexual health is important, it can be a difficult task. Many patients are uncomfortable asking questions or sharing concerns, and providers themselves often address the topic too quickly or not at all. As an illustration, 2012 national survey of U.S. OB-GYNs revealed that only 40 percent of those surveyed routinely ask questions to assess for sexual problems or dysfunction and only 29 percent routinely ask patients about satisfaction with their sexual lives. Fewer than a third—28 percent—routinely confirm a patient’s sexual orientation.
Part of the problem is starting the conversation. A 2009 poll of 304 US healthcare providers by the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP) and HealthyWomen found that 74 percent of providers rely on their patients to initiate a discussion about sexual health. A survey that same year by the Women’s Sexual Health Foundation found that approximately the same amount of patients—73 percent preferred—that the healthcare provider brings up the topic of sexual health.
Communicating with patients about their sexual health is an essential part of patient care. After all, sexual health is an important part of overall health and routinely addressing sexual health issues can help destigmatize the subject of sex and sexual behavior and help increase patients’ comfort level in seeking care.
Below are selected resources to help improve communication with patients around sexual health.
Developed by the National Association of Community Health Centers and the Fenway Institute’s National LGBT Health Education Center, the toolkit Taking Routine Histories of Sexual Health: A System-Wide Approach for Health Centers facilitates the taking of routine sexual health histories as part of primary care visits. Key components of the toolkit are available as Word documents so that they can easily be customized and branded for your organization.
“The Proactive Sexual Health History”: This article from American Family Physician discusses a routine way to elicit the patient’s sexual history that avoids judgmental attitudes and asks the patient for permission to discuss sexual function.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers A Guide to Taking a Sexual Health History, a printable 24-page booklet on discussing sexual health issues with patients, with a specific focus on sexually transmitted infections (STI). The guide includes sample dialogue to use to assess a patient’s risk for sexually transmitted infections.
The National Coalition for Sexual Health offers Sexual Health and Your Patients, a provider’s guide created to help primary care providers learn how to better incorporate sexual health discussions and recommended preventive sexual health services into an adult or adolescent wellness visit.
Talking to Young Patients about Sexual Health
This video from CDC looks discusses the importance of a healthy dialogue between providers and young patients concerning their sexual health and features CDC Epidemiologist, Elizabeth Torrone, Ph.D. MSPH.

Growing older is a natural and exciting part of life. Just as people age so does the body. Being mindful of the natural changes your body goes through is an important part of learning how to promote your sexual health and the sexual health of your partner.
Natural changes in the body can mean different things for how to protect yourself. Understanding the changes your body is going through can help you have a healthy sex life as you age. Keep in mind that everyone’s body is different and may age differently:
Men
Delayed erection
Less semen
Shorter orgasm
Women
Less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful.
Can be less easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking, which can result in decreased interest in sex.
While women leave their reproductive years once they experience menopause, men’s reproductive years never end. Men continue to produce sperm (in lesser amounts) as they grow older. So men with younger partners who have not yet gone through menopause must still talk about pregnancy and contraception.
As we age, pregnancy becomes less of a concern with menopause or sterilisation procedures, like  vasectomies, but men and women should still use condoms. Why? Well, although you may be less likely to get pregnant you are still able to get STDs/STIs at any point in your life when you are sexually active– this risk does not go down with age
Imagine this—Helen who is only 60 was married to Stan for more than 30 years when he died. About four years after Stan died, an old friend who Helen hadn’t heard from in more than 20 years contacted her. They were always fond of each other so when they both found themselves without a partner, they started dating. Months later, they started sleeping together. Before long Helen felt different, and she was worried. She went to her doctor who tested her and then told her she had HIV. It seems Stan’s last partner had HIV and hadn’t yet been diagnosed.
According to the CDC, people aged 50 and older accounted for:
15% of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses (People 50 years or older are getting HIV faster than people under 40 years)
24% of persons living with HIV/AIDS (increased from 17% in 2001)
In addition, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea and syphilis among older people have nearly doubled from 1996 to 2003.
You can reduce your risk for HIV and other STDs/STIs:
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk.
Make sure you and your partner get tested (before you start having sex).
Use a condom and lubricant every time you have sex.
If you think you may have been exposed to an STD/STI, get treatment.
Do not have sex when you are taking drugs or drinking alcohol because being high can make you more likely to take risks.

Search this websiteNGU
Nongonococcal urethritis—or NGU—is an infection of the urethra caused by pathogens (germs) other than gonorrhea. Several kinds of pathogens can cause NGU, including:
Chlamydia trachomatis
Ureaplasma urealyticum
Trichomonas vaginalis (rare)
Herpes simplex virus (rare)
Adenovirus
Haemophilus vaginalis
Mycoplasm genitalium
NGU is most often caused by chlamydia, a common infection in men and women. The diagnosis of NGU is more commonly made in men than women, primarily due to anatomical differences.
FAQs
How is it transmitted?
Sexual
Most germs that cause NGU can be passed during sex (vaginal, anal or oral) that involves direct mucous membrane contact with an infected person. These germs can be passed even if the penis or tongue does not go all the way into the vagina, mouth or rectum, and even if body fluids are not exchanged.
Nonsexual
Urinary tract infections.
An inflamed prostate gland due to bacteria (bacterial prostatitis).
A narrowing or closing of the tube in the penis (urethral stricture).
A tightening of the foreskin so that it cannot be pulled back from the head of the penis (phimosa).
The result of a process such as inserting a tube into the penis (catheterization).
Perinatal
During birth, infants maybe exposed to the germs causing NGU in passage through the birth canal. This may cause the baby to have infections in the:
eyes (conjunctivitis)
ears
lungs (pneumonia)
What are the symptoms?
Men (urethral infection)
Discharge from the penis
Burning or pain when urinating (peeing)
Itching, irritation, or tenderness
Underwear stain
Women (vaginal/urethral infection)
The germs that cause NGU in men might cause other infections in women. These might include vaginitis or mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC). Women may also be asymptomatic (have no symptoms). Symptoms of NGU in women can include:
Discharge from the vagina
Burning or pain when urinating (peeing)
Abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding may be an indication that the infection has progressed to Pelvic inflammatory Disease (PID)
Anal or Oral Infections
Anal infection may result in rectal itching, discharge, or pain on defecation. Oral infection may occur. Most (90%) are asymptomatic, but some people might have a sore throat.
How is it diagnosed?An NGU diagnosis is made when a man has urethritis (inflammation of the urethra), but gonorrhea is ruled out because he has a negative gonorrhea culture and/or gram stain. Other tests include chlamydia culture or urinalysis (sometimes, but rarely).
In women, it may be diagnosed by chlamydia culture. A gonorrhea culture may be done to rule out gonorrhea.
How is it treated?
The main treatments for NGU are:
Azithromycin
Doxycycline
Alternatives are:
Erythromycin
Ofloxacin
Recommended treatment for recurrent/persistent urethritis:
Metronidazole with Erythromycin
A woman who is pregnant, or thinks she might be, should tell her doctor. This will ensure that a medicine will be used that will not harm the baby.
Follow-up:
Take all medications-even if you start to feel better before you finish the bottle.
Treat all partners.
Inform all partners.
Abstain from sex until all partners are treated.
Return for evaluation by a health care provider if symptoms persist or if symptoms recur after taking all the prescribed medicine.
What does it mean for my health?Left untreated, the germs that cause NGU-especially chlamydia-can lead to complications:
Men
Epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, the elongated, cordlike structure along the posterior border of the testes) which can lead to infertility if left untreated.
Reiter’s syndrome (arthritis)
Conjunctivitis
Skin lesions
Discharge
Women
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) which can result in ectopic (tubal) pregnancy.
Recurrent PID may lead to infertility.
Chronic pelvic pain
Urethritis
Vaginitis
Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC)
Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage)
Men or Women
Infections caused by anal sex might lead to severe proctitis (inflamed rectum).
Infants
Exposure to the germs causing NGU during passage through the birth canal may result in infants having:
Conjunctivitis (If left untreated, this may lead to blindness.)
Pneumonia
How can I reduce my risk?
Abstinence from sex is the best form of prevention.
Using latex condoms from start to finish every time you have oral, vaginal or anal sex.
Having sex with only one uninfected partner whom only has sex with you (mutual monogamy).
Water-based spermicides can be used along with latex condoms for additional protection during vaginal intercourse. Use of spermicide is not recommended nor found to be effective for oral or anal intercourse.
Have regular check-ups if you are sexually active.
If you have an STD, don’t have sex (oral, vaginal, anal) until all partners have been treated.
Prompt, qualified and appropriate medical intervention, treatment and follow-up are important steps in breaking the disease cycle.
Know your partner(s). Careful consideration and open communication between partners may protect all partners involved from infection.
How do I tell my partner?If you have been told that you have NGU, talk to your partner(s), and let them know so they can be tested and treated. The most common cause of NGU is chlamydia, and it is easy to pass from an infected partner to one who is not infected. A man who is diagnosed with NGU should tell his female sex partner and ask her to get tested. He can prevent lasting damage to her body by telling her right away. All sex partners of someone diagnosed with NGU should be treated because:
They may have an infection and not know it.
It keeps them from passing the infection back to you or to others.
It prevents them from suffering possible complications.
Remember: Do not have sex until your partner(s) have been tested and treated.

It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

June 26, 2018
As rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among racial and ethnic minorities continue to rise, local health departments and community-based organizations are continuously exploring effective methods of reaching these populations with sexual health messaging and education. Effective use of social media and social marketing techniques can increase dissemination and reach of health promotion messages targeting sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in underserved populations. One such population is African-American men.
In 2016, African-American men experienced the highest reported rates of primary and secondary syphilis and gonorrhea across all other races/ethnicities and genders, as well as the highest rates of chlamydia among all other racial/ethnic groups. Improving and addressing male SRH needs, particularly in adolescent and young adult populations, are concrete objectives in Healthy People 2020. The benefits of addressing male SRH contribute to improving the lives of individual men and boys, but also extend to their partners, children, families and communities. Yet, compared to female SRH needs, men – particularly heterosexual men – receive minimal attention in literature, clinical health services, and community-based and population health interventions. Additionally, limited guidance exists on effectively reaching African-American men with SRH health promotion messages.
Health is Power (HisP), a social marketing campaign created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of STD Prevention (DSTDP), was specifically designed for heterosexual African-American men, ages 18-30. The campaign seeks to promote positive sexual behaviors through a multi-phased campaign with strength-based messaging around increased condom use, healthy relationships, STD testing and prevention, and open partner communication. The “Health is Power Toolkit” provides various health promotion tools including customizable posters, postcards, social media messages, web banners, and “drop-in” website articles. The availability of these resources allows for further dissemination of the HisP messages along with the option to further evaluate the efficacy of HisP messages within local communities.
In 2016, the National Association of County and City Health Officials and CDC DSTDP partnered with Louisiana Public Health Institute (New Orleans, Louisiana), CCM Foundation (Houston, Texas) and Baltimore City Health Department (Baltimore, Maryland) to conduct demonstration site projects focused on implementing and evaluating local HisP campaigns. Demonstration sites adapted and expanded HisP messages and materials to meet the needs of their local target audience, developed customized implementation plans, and evaluated campaign reach and effectiveness. NACCHO provided technical and capacity-building assistance on effective implementation and evaluation of local HisP efforts. The HisP demonstration sites will finish implementing and evaluating their campaigns by the end of June 2018. Over the next few months, NACCHO will be highlighting the results of this demonstration site project on their website. Stay tuned for detailed information regarding HisP implementation and evaluation results.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

ASHA publishes Position Statements on emerging issues in health policy as part of its advocacy work. These statements are intended to reflect the perspective of Americans affected by sexually transmitted infections and outline the key reasoning and evidence behind ASHA’s recommendations.
Talking To Your Teens About STI PreventionWe don’t like talking with our youth about sex. Parents have difficulty talking with their adolescent children about sex. Schools often are constrained by societal pressures and funding sources to provide “abstinence only” messages rather than comprehensive sexual health information. In contrast, our entertainment media portrays human sexuality as spontaneous and idyllic, without complications of relationships or sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.
The truth is that sexually transmitted infections (also called sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) are an enormous problem in the United States, especially for adolescents and young adults. April is STD Awareness Month and a good time to talk about this uncomfortable but important issue.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections. The number of new cases of sexually transmitted infections is more than 9 million in people under the age of 25 each year.
Even worse, many of these are silent infections without clinical symptoms. Despite the absence of symptoms, long-term damage such as infertility can occur if infections are not diagnosed and treated. And many youth (and adults) assume that they would know if they or their partner had an infection.
The best way to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection is to be tested for it. Great strides have been made in recent years in development of reliable tests for many STIs using patient specimens that can be obtained easily.
Most youth assume they are being tested for “all” STIs when they go to their doctor. In fact, testing rarely occurs even for the more common infections, even though health care guidelines and medical associations recommend testing be done routinely.
Communication is an important issue in obtaining testing. Just as adults are reluctant to discuss sexual health issues with youth, youth are also reluctant to discuss this with adults, including health care providers. Young people need the necessary information to know what and how to ask for tests for STIs.
Testing, treatment and communication are all important in addressing the STI epidemic. But they are not sufficient. Knowledge and prevention are essential also.
Of great concern is the politicization of sexual health information, which makes it difficult to be certain about the accuracy and context of messages. Groups that attack the effectiveness of condoms for preventing STIs, for example, hope this will encourage abstinence. Instead, it leaves our young people at risk.
The simple fact is that condoms, used correctly and consistently, provide substantial protection against many STIs, including HIV infection. They do not protect against all STIs or under all circumstances, but for a person who chooses to be sexually active, using a condom is much better than not using one.
The stigma attached to many diseases such as cancer a generation ago has disappeared. But sexual behaviors and STIs remain highly stigmatized in our country. This stigma inhibits discussion with parents, partners, and health care providers and discourages youth from seeking needed health care. Stigma is a significant barrier to prevention. Social attitudes that reinforce this shame do not reduce frequency of sexual contact but they do reduce prevention behaviors and increase risk of infection.
It is biologically certain that our children will grow up and become sexually mature. STIs have been with humans for centuries. Information, education, supportive social environments, and sound, well-funded public health programs are effective at reducing risks of infection. Our failure to address these issues leaves our youth vulnerable. We as a nation need to review the lessons of the past and make effective control of STIs a high priority.
James Allen, MD, MPH
Former President and CEO, ASHA
Worker Health and Safety in the Adult Film IndustryFor almost a century, the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) has sought to protect the sexual health of our nation. Since our inception in 1914, we have worked to inform policymakers, the public, health care providers and the press about the harmful consequences of unprotected and high-risk sexual activity. We have worked with policy makers to achieve sustained structural and institutional change to help Americans protect their sexual health.
Therefore, we are particularly concerned by the business practices and the current working conditions in the adult film industry and the lack of government oversight to protect workers. Workers are required in the course of their employment to engage in oral, vaginal and anal sex acts, often with multiple partners, within short periods of time, and without barrier protection. Workers may be regularly exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and the subsequent life-threatening and serious adverse reproductive health sequelae.
The very nature of the adult film industry exposes workers to great risk of infectious diseases. Abstinence, limiting the number of sex partners, condoms and education which are traditionally considered central to reducing the risk of STIs including HIV are not options available to workers in this industry. An HIV outbreak that occurred in 2004 demonstrates the serious health risk to workers in this industry. A performer who had tested regularly for HIV but who was working without condoms transmitted HIV to three others in the workplace.
It is essential that workers in the adult film industry use condoms and that those who produce adult films are held accountable, as are employers in any other industry, for maintaining a safe workplace that ensures the health and safety of those they employ. Just as personal protective equipment such as gloves for health care workers or goggles or masks are used to reduce the risk of injury or acquiring an infectious disease, condoms should be mandatory to protect workers in this industry.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for setting workplace standards and the enforcement of those standards. California OSHA has created standards specific to protecting adult film workers. Unfortunately, the standards have been ignored by the industry and enforcement is inadequate.
Increased regulation of the adult film industry has broad public health benefits that can not be overstated. Protecting workers from STIs also reduces harm to their families and limits spread to others in the community. Mandatory use of condoms, routine HIV and STI testing, and hepatitis and HPV vaccination would greatly enhance the health and safety of those who work in this industry.
This is not an inconsequential industry. It is estimated that the adult film industry earns an estimated $13 billion in gross revenues each year. It is appropriate and imperative that health and safety standards are applied and fully enforced to protect workers in this industry.
Over-the-Counter, Home-Use, Rapid HIV TestsThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) has been informing the public about, and advocating for, the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases since 1914. Since its inception, ASHA has strongly encouraged early diagnosis and treatment as a way to reduce further transmission in the community.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently estimates that about 250,000 – 300,000 people in the United States are infected yet unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Since HIV infection often takes a decade to develop into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), people living with HIV who remain undiagnosed risk spreading HIV without their knowledge for many years.
For two decades, ASHA has been an advocate of broader availability and use of HIV tests to facilitate more rapid diagnosis and treatment for those infected and to prevent further transmission in the community. Unfortunately, many people avoid or are unable to get tested in clinics or a physician’s office for a variety of reasons, including lack of access to health care services, distrust of the healthcare system, and the stigma of discovery.
We support CDC’s goals to implement new models for diagnosing HIV infection outside medical settings and to prevent new infections by working with persons diagnosed with HIV and their partners. A greater set of options, including over-the-counter, home-use, rapid HIV tests, may increase the number of people willing to be tested.
Clearly, it would be preferable for all individuals seeking HIV testing to receive pre- and post-test counseling in a supportive environment. However, the availability of these home-use tests could be a very powerful strategy to reduce barriers to testing and increase early detection of HIV infection.
It is imperative that those who test negative fully understand the implications of their test results, and those who test positive to have immediate access to counseling services and referral to quality medical care.
Comprehensive Sexual Health EducationThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) supports comprehensive health and sexuality education programs in the schools, from kindergarten through the 12th grade. The content of this education should include medically accurate and developmentally appropriate discussions of sexuality, reproduction, fertility, methods of contraception, decision-making, delaying first intercourse, abstinence, risk assessment and risk reduction, and sexually transmitted disease prevention, with special emphasis placed on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
ASHA urges states to adopt mandates requiring comprehensive, developmentally appropriate, and medically accurate sexuality education programs that:
are based on rigorous, peer reviewed published research;
show promise for delaying the onset of sexual activity and a reduction in sexual behavior that puts adolescents at risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, and for becoming pregnant;
include both factual information and skills building lessons related to reproductive biology, pregnancy, sexual transmission of diseases, sexual abstinence, sexual responsibility, communication, decision-making, and condom use;
include ample involvement of parents, health professionals, and other concerned community members in the development of the program;
include an ongoing evaluation component; and
are part of an overall health education program.
Male Latex Condoms as a Public Health InterventionThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) supports the promotion and use of male latex condoms as a public health prevention measure designed to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently.
The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is to abstain from sexual intercourse or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is not infected with any sexually transmitted infections.
For millions of people who have previously acquired a viral sexually transmitted infection, however, effective measures must be taken to protect any future partners from infection. In the United States, there are 50 million people estimated to be infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV), 20 million people estimated to be infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), and 850,000-950,000 people estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.
Non-viral STDs also remain important public health challenges. Two of these diseases, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are regularly among the leading reportable infectious diseases in the United States.
Many people engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for acquiring STDs. Sexually active people must have access to information and options to reduce their risk. The male latex condom effectively reduces the risk of STD transmission when used correctly and consistently.
Numerous studies have shown that latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, have been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.
Correct and consistent use of male latex condoms can reduce the risk of transmitting genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is covered and protected.
While the effect of male latex condoms in preventing transmission of human papillomavirus is not known, studies have shown that condom use has been associated with lower rates of cervical cancer in women, an HPV-associated disease.
Therefore, correct and consistent use of male latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of transmission for these infections.
Race, Ethnicity & Sexually Transmitted DiseasesAfrican American and Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) believes the STD epidemic in communities of color requires the development of effectively targeted national prevention strategies. Sexually transmitted diseases are fueled by poverty, lack of access to health care, distrust of health systems, inadequate resources, and myriad other social factors and inequities. The coexistence of STDs with other social problems, including unemployment, teenage pregnancy, drug use/distribution and violence often impedes attempts to provide services, particularly since these other problems are often perceived as more compelling than sexual health issues.
The complexity of this problem is exacerbated by our national discomfort in discussing both race and the stigma associated with STDs. Yet the data suggest action is needed: African American adolescents and young adults have STD rates that are more than 20 times higher than those in white adolescents.
Comprehensive chlamydia screening programs for women thus far show higher rates for minority women than for white women.
Non-white women are nearly three times as likely as white women to be hospitalized with acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and more than two times as likely to be hospitalized with chronic PID.
African American women are nearly three times more likely to die of cervical cancer than white women.
Reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis are about three times higher for Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites.
Recommendations:
Involve all racial/ethnic communities in STD prevention. including planning, developing, implementing and evaluating programs.
Develop culturally competent/sensitive and linguistically appropriate behavioral interventions for STD and HIV prevention in minority communities.
Integrate STD prevention with other relevant programs through which the affected population has been successfully reached.
Identify methods to overcome potential reporting bias, including increased and improved enforcement of mandatory reporting requirements by private providers to assist in alleviating reporting bias.
Raising and Supporting Sexually Healthy YouthWe live in a sexual world, from birth to death, and the messages children receive from parents, television and films, musicians, actors, politicians, peers, and advertisers shape their views about sexuality. American society appears at times to narrow its focus from the broad nature of human sexuality to a fixation on sexual intercourse. Further troubling is the negative light in which this focus continues to be shone. We need to have a broad definition of sexuality, encompassing the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors related to being female or male, being attracted and attractive to others, and being in love, as well as the broad implications of experiencing sexual intimacy and engaging in physical sexual activity.
The American Sexual Health Association, recognizing that all people are sexual beings from birth to death, asserts that all members of society have certain rights and consequent responsibilities:
Adolescents have rights to balanced, accurate, and realistic sex education, access to confidential sexual health services, and a secure stake in the future. Respect and should be included in shaping programs and policies that affect their well-being.
Society has the responsibility to provide young people with the tools needed to safeguard their sexual health and protect them from unwanted and coerced sexual activity
Adolescents have the responsibility to protect themselves from bearing children too early and from acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
Collaborating with Faith-Based OrganizationsThe American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) recognizes and appreciates the strength, vision, and influence inherent in communities of faith. These communities are often central to the lives of their members, and therefore play a critical role in caring for the minds, bodies and spirits of their members and the larger community. Self-concept and concepts related to health and healing are often formed according to religious tradition and influence. For example:
In the area of childhood and adult immunization
Faith-based organizations and communities often serve as the primary caregivers of our nation’s youth as well as the elderly. Through pre-school, after-school and adult-care programs, they have a unique opportunity to ensure that families have access to information about vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as access to the vaccines themselves.
In the area of adolescent health
Faith-based organizations and communities have historically played a critical role in the socialization and development of their members. In an era where adolescents are increasingly more vulnerable to health-related threats and challenges, these organizations can play a critical role in educating their membership about the biological and social factors that place youth at greater risk than those in other age groups.
In the area of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Faith-based organizations and communities can be a powerful force in the prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, by creating an atmosphere which reduces the stigma surrounding these infections and encourages the acquisition of information and skills necessary to prevent their transmission.
Recommendations:
Public health officials should seek input from faith-based organizations when deciding health policy. Agencies responsible for public health should collaborate with faith-based organizations when conducting community needs assessments and implementing health education and prevention programs. Including clergy and representatives of faith-based organization on boards of directors, community planning initiatives and on governing bodies can be useful. Researchers should include faith-based organizations in efforts to promote and conduct health research.

Search this websiteExternal Condoms
An external condom, also known as a male condom, is a thin cover that is placed over the penis to protect against sexually transmitted infections and to prevent pregnancy by blocking semen from leaving the condom. Male condoms are inexpensive, easy to find, not hard to use (a little instruction never hurts, though! See below.) and really, really effective against HIV, chlamydia and a host of other sexually transmitted infections when used-as the public health mantra goes-consistently and correctly. Not a bad choice against unintended pregnancy, either.
In sum, condoms work. Condoms work best when you know some basic facts and understand how to use them. The facts on this page will help you have a better idea of how to use condoms correctly and protect your (and your partner’s) health.
General rules:
Treat condoms gently and keep them out of the sun.
With latex condoms, never use lotions, baby oil, Vaseline®: or cold cream — the oil in these products weakens the condom.
If you use a lubricant, use one made with water (such as K-Y®: jelly or glycerin).
Regular use of spermicidal lubricants should be avoided as they may cause skin irritation.
Put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth or anus.
How to Use a Male Condom
First, check the expiration date and for any obvious rips or tears in the packaging.
(Just as old rubber bands break easily, latex condoms become less elastic and more susceptible to breaking after their expiration date.)
Move the condom out of the way and tear open the packaging.
Hold the condom by the tip to squeeze out the air.
Leave some space at the tip to hold the ejaculate (cum).
Unroll the condom all the way over the erect penis.
If you put the condom on and start to unroll it the wrong way, don’t flip it over and put it on again. Throw the condom out and start again with a new condom.
After sex, the man should hold the condom at the rim, face away from his partner, and pull out slowly while the penis is still hard.
Use a new condom if you want to have sex again or if moving from the anus to the vagina (preventing the spread of bacteria).
Dos and Don’ts
DON’T store condoms in a hot place.
DO keep condoms in a cool, dry place
DON’T use out of date condoms or ones whose packaging is torn or damaged.
DO check the expiration date. Old condoms can be dry and can break more easily.
DON’T use scissors or your teeth when opening a condom–you might tear it.
DO open condoms with care.
DON’T try to put a condom on before the penis is erect (hard).
DO put the condom on an erect penis before there is any contact with a partner’s genitals.
DON’T use oil-based lube with latex condoms. The oil can cause latex condoms to break.
DO use a water-based lube with latex condoms.
DON’T flip a condom over and reuse it if you put it on the wrong way. Throw it out and get a new one.
DO throw out a condom after you use it. Never reuse a condom.

HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids, or breast milk of an HIV-infected person.
Over time, infection with HIV can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. These infections are usually controlled by a healthy immune system, but they can cause problems or even be life-threatening in someone with AIDS.
A blood test can determine if a person is infected with HIV. Too many people don’t know they have HIV. In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and almost one in five don’t know they are infected. Getting tested is the first step to finding out if you have HIV. If you have HIV, getting medical care and taking medicines regularly helps you live a longer, healthier life and also lowers the chances of passing HIV on to others.
If a person tests positive for HIV, it does not necessarily mean that the person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition. A person infected with HIV may receive an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. A person with HIV can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses.
FAQs
Where did HIV come from?There are many theories about the origin of HIV. The first known case was found in a blood sample collected from man from Kinshasha, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. Genetic analysis of this blood suggests that the origin of HIV came from a single strain of HIV-1 in the 1940s or 1950s. In the U.S. the virus is known to have existed since the mid 1970s. Symptoms of rare types of what are now known as opportunistic infections began manifesting themselves between 1979-1981. HIV was first isolated by scientists in 1983. The virus was at first called HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
What is AIDS?A diagnosis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is made by a physician. An HIV-infected person may be diagnosed with AIDS if he or she meets certain clinical criteria. Criteria include becoming sick with an illness defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an AIDS-indicator illness (illnesses that take advantage of the body’s weakened immune system) and/or by taking a blood test that shows that the person’s immune system is severely damaged.
What are the symptoms of HIV?Most people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected, because they do not feel ill immediately after infection. However, some people do experience a illness with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes. If an immune reaction to HIV occurs, it usually takes place between 1 and 6 weeks after HIV infection has happened. A person with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you, especially during the initial infection period. You cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. The only way to determine whether HIV is present in a person’s body is by testing.
How does HIV become AIDS?AIDS is a disease caused by HIV. HIV infects cells of the human immune system and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus leads to slow destruction of a persons’ immune system making them more susceptible to many kinds of infections. Once a person with HIV develops any one of a number of rare infections or cancers – tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiases or tumors – they are said to have AIDS. This most often occurs 10-15 years after a person becomes infected with HIV.
How long does it take for HIV to cause AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prior to 1996, scientists estimated that about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years after becoming infected. This time varied greatly from person to person and depended on many factors, including a person’s health status and their health-related behaviors.
Since 1996, the introduction of powerful anti-retroviral therapies has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. There are also other medical treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, though the treatments do not cure AIDS itself. Because of these advances in drug therapies and other medical treatments, estimates of how many people will develop AIDS and how soon are being recalculated, revised, or are currently under study.
How common are HIV and AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 million persons in the United States are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. CDC estimates there are over 41,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year.
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that, since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 60 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes. UNAIDS estimates that about 33.4 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2008.
Who does HIV affect?There are various risk factors that make some people more at risk for contracting HIV than others. Most people, however, run some risk of contracting HIV as they share in one or more of the following risk factors:
Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex
Early age of first sexual activity—It is common for youth to engage in sexual activity before receiving information about HIV prevention
Heterosexual sex–Women and minorities are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection
Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)–Stigma and discrimination make it more difficult for MSM to access testing and counseling services
Sexually transmitted infection (STIs)–The presence of other STIs can greatly increase the likelihood of HIV transmission
Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex
Exchange sex for money
Substance abuse—Chronic and intermittent substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors while using. Injection drug users also run the risk of being infected by HIV while sharing unclean needles.
Poverty—Socioeconomic factors can directly and indirectly influence a person’s vulnerability to HIV infection. For many people poverty prevents access to quality health care.
Out-of-school youth—Those that drop out of school are more likely to become sexually active younger and less likely to use condoms and other types of contraception.
Lack of awareness—Many people, particularly youth, don’t recognize the ways in which they are vulnerable to HIV infection, making them more likely to behave in ways that put them at risk.
How safe is the U.S. blood supply?The U.S. blood supply is one of the safest in the world. Infection through blood transfusion and other blood products is rare. Since 1985, the blood supply has been ELISA tested for HIV. According to the CDC, an estimated 1 in 450,000 to 1 in 660,000 donations per year are infectious for HIV but are not detected by current antibody screening tests. In 1995, blood banks also began testing with P24 tests along with ELISA, to detect infection with HIV during this window period. As technology advances, the blood supply will become even safer.
How is HIV transmitted?HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids (semen, preseminal fluid, or vaginal fluid) or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. People can get HIV one of these fluids enters the body by way of the mucous membranes (the soft, moist skin found in any opening of the body) or the bloodstream. The virus can be passed during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with a HIV-infected person. An HIV-infected mother can transmit HIV to her infant during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. People can also become infected with HIV when using injection drugs through sharing needles and other equipment (or works) including cookers and cottons with someone who is infected.
The risk of transmission varies with the type of exposure (e.g. sexual, needle sharing, etc.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a table quantifying the this HIV transmission risk that comes from different types of exposures. See the table and explanation at the CDC website.
How effective are latex condoms at preventing HIV?Studies have been done to test how well latex condoms work for preventing HIV transmission. This research has shown that latex condoms are highly effective at protecting a person from transmitting or becoming infected with the virus. The studies were done on HIV-negative individuals at high-risk for the disease because there partners were HIV-positive. Latex condoms used consistently and correctly were effective 98-100% of the time.
While not having sex or to having sex with a long-term mutually monogamous partner who is not infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is the only way to protect yourself completely, latex condoms used consistently and correctly are highly effective in preventing HIV and many other STIs.
Can I get HIV from casual contact? HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or in the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone’s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-positive person, playing sports with or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by anyone living with HIV. There is no evidence that HIV is spread through kissing. So you should not be fearful of interacting with persons who are living with the disease.

The most recent Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report, released by the CDC in October, revealed that 1,526,658 cases of chlamydia were reported in 2015—the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to CDC. But the reported rate does not necessarily reflect the total burden of chlamydia either; because the infection is asymptomatic in most people (about 7 out of 10), many cases are undiagnosed, despite the recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) calling for annual chlamydia for all sexually active adolescents and young women age 25 years and under.
The National Chlamydia Coalition has developed resources to help you learn more about how to integrate chlamydia screening into clinical practice and determine ways to address issues such as maintaining confidentiality for teen patients and taking a sexual history.
Screening for Chlamydia
Routine chlamydia screening is recommended for all sexually active adolescents and young women age 25 years and under. Women over age 25 with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, all pregnant women, and men who have sex with men, or are in high risk settings should also be screened. Chlamydia is easily detected from a swab or urine specimen and treated with antibiotics. Rescreening and treating sexual partners prevents re-infection. The National Commission on Prevention Priorities ranks chlamydia screening as a high value, but underused clinical preventive service. Chlamydia screening could reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by up to 60%. To view the most recent HEDIS screening data, click here.

Masturbation is a normal and a healthy form of sexual expression. In fact, over 88% of people say that they masturbate on a regular basis. So why don’t we talk about it?  Masturbation has gotten a bad rap over the years. The truth is that you should never feel ashamed of talking about sexual pleasure, especially masturbation.
It really is all about you!
Not everyone has or wants a partner. There is no “right way” to have sex. As long as everyone is consenting, you should do it your way. The great thing about masturbation is that you are free to explore at your own pace. Want to try out a new toy? Go for it! Testing out a new technique? The world is your oyster.
It might even be good for you!
There are many documented benefits of orgasms: it can relieve stress, boost the immune system, improve sleep, and relieve muscle tension and menstrual cramps.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a serious infection in the upper genital tract/reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries) of a female. PID can be sexually transmitted or naturally occurring. It can lead to infertility in women (unable to have children) or life-threatening complications.
FAQs
How common is it?Women between ages 15 and 25 have the highest incidence of PID. In the United States, PID is the leading cause of infertility in women (the inability to have children).
How is it transmitted?Two other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chlamydia and gonorrhea, are the most common causes of PID. Other bacteria or germs can also cause PID. If you have an infection in the genital tract and do not get treated right away, it can cause PID. The infection spreads from the cervix into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It can take anywhere from several days to several months after being infected to develop PID.
What can cause an infection to spread into the upper genital tract?
Using an intrauterine device (IUD). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk for PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion and is uncommon thereafter.
Germs
Douching. Women who douche once or twice a month are more likely to have PID than those who douche less than once a month. Douching may also ease symptoms of an infection, thus delaying effective treatment.
What are the symptoms?
Dull pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen
Burning or pain when you urinate (pee)
Nausea and vomiting
Bleeding between menstrual periods
Increased or changed vaginal discharge
Pain during sex
Fever and chills
It is possible for a woman to have PID and be asymptomatic (without symptoms), or have symptoms too mild to notice, for an unknown period of time. PID can also be misdiagnosed as appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts or other problems.
How is it diagnosed?The diagnosis of PID can be made when all three of the following symptoms are found during a pelvic exam:
Lower abdominal tenderness
Tenderness of fallopian tubes and ovaries
Tenderness of the cervix
All other explanations for these findings must have been ruled out, so your healthcare provider may also order tests to identify the organism which led to the infection (such as chlamydia or gonorrhea) or to distinguish between PID and other problems with similar symptoms.
A pelvic ultrasound is a helpful procedure for diagnosing PID. An ultrasound can view the pelvic area to see whether the fallopian tubes are enlarged or whether an abscess (pus-filled area) is present.
In some cases, a laparoscopy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A laparoscopy is a surgical procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a lighted end (laparoscope) is inserted through a small incision in the lower abdomen. This procedure enables the doctor to view the internal pelvic organs and to take specimens for laboratory studies, if needed.
How is it treated?
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the recommended treatment, as they can cover the likely pathogens.
Treatment may include antimicrobial agents to treat gonorrhea, chlamydia, streptococci and other gram-negative bacteria.
Ofloxacin (oh-flox-ah-sin) tablets (FLOXIN) can be used alone to treat PID.
Aggressive treatment of PID is recommended for women with HIV, who may be more likely to require surgical intervention.
Sex partners of patients who have PID should be examined and treated if they have had recent sexual contact to avoid re-infection.
Follow-up:
Take all medications as directed.
You may need a follow-up exam 48 to 72 hours after start of treatment to make sure the medicine is working.
Return for another exam after completion of treatment to make sure the infection is completely gone.
Tell your partner to get tested and treated.
Remember: Do not have sex until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured.
Hospitalization to treat PID may be recommended if a woman:
is severely ill (nausea, vomiting, and high fever);
is pregnant;
does not respond to or cannot take oral medication and needs intravenous antibiotics;
has an abscess (infected area with pus) in the fallopian tube or ovary.
If symptoms continue or if an abscess does not go away, surgery may be needed. Complications of PID, such as chronic pelvic pain and scarring are difficult to treat, but sometimes they improve with surgery.
What does it mean for my health?
Untreated PID infections may lead to:
Infertility. Because of PID, each year more than 100,000 women will not be able to have children as a result of scarring or damage to cells lining the fallopian tubes.
Cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder)
Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy
Recurrent episodes of PID
Chronic pelvic pain
How can I reduce my risk?
Abstain (do not have sex).
Use latex condoms for vaginal, oral and anal sex from the very beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact.
Mutual monogamy (have sex with only one uninfected partner). Multiple sex partners can increase your risk for getting any STI and developing PID.
Have regular check-ups if you are sexually active.
If you have an STI, do not have sex (oral, vaginal or anal) until all partners have been treated and cured. Treatment and follow-up are important steps in breaking the disease cycle.
Water-based spermicides (foams, jellies, creams, or suppositories) can be used along with latex condoms for additional protection during vaginal intercourse. Use of spermicide is not recommended nor found to be effective for oral or anal intercourse.
Since PID can be transmitted even if the penis or tongue does not completely enter the vagina, mouth or rectum, using latex condoms from the beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact is recommended.
How do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard, but keep in mind that most people with an STI don’t know they have it. It’s important that you talk to your partner as soon as possible so she or he can get treatment. Men are more likely than women to have symptoms of chlamydia or gonorrhea (two STIs that cause PID). It is possible to pass PID back and forth, so if you get treated and your partner doesn’t, you may get infected again.

Search this websiteSelf image
Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

Taking care of young people is often a challenge, since they often do not visit their healthcare provider on a regular basis (especially boys and young men). These tools – companion pieces to age-specific self-assessments for young males and females – are meant to trigger questions you may want to ask, even for patients in the office for a simple sports physical. ASHA’s goal is that every provider visit involves these important topics.
The tools were developed through a number of activities, including a literature review and research with the target audiences. As a healthcare provider you have power as well.
The checklist for healthcare providers (female patients ages 9-young adult)
The checklist for healthcare providers (male patients ages 10-18
A patient self-assessment tool for females ages 9-14.
A patient self-assessment tool for males ages 10-13.
A patient self-assessment tool for females ages 15-young adult.
A patient self-assessment tool for males ages 14-18.
These tools were developed by the American Sexual Health Association, School-Based Health Alliance, Healthy Teen Network, and Partnership for Male Youth, through an independent educational grant from Merck and Company.
Treating Adolescent Male Patients: An Interview with Dr. David Bell
To explore issues related to the examination of the young male patient, ASHA had a conversation with Dr. David Bell for our Sex+Health podcast. Dr Bell discusses ways to build rapport with patients, elements of the physical examination, immunizations, sexual health, and other matters of relevance to this population. Dr. Bell is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Population and Family Health at the Columbia University Medical Center. He is also the Medical Director of The Young Men’s Clinic at the New York Presbyterian Hospital.

CME/CE Credit for Physicians and Nurses
In collaboration with WebMD and The Yellow Umbrella Organization, ASHA has developed an activity, A 16-Year-Old Boy in the Clinic for a Sports Physical, for pediatricians, nurses, and primary care physicians. The goal is to reinforce knowledge of the indications for HPV vaccination in males. See more here.

Also in collaboration with WebMD and The Yellow Umbrella Organization, ASHA has developed an activity, An 11-Year-Old Girl Due for Vaccinations, for pediatricians, nurses, obstetricians and gynecologists, and primary care physicians. The goal is to provide guidance on responding to human papillomavirus (HPV)-vaccine-hesitant parents.
The Importance of Talking to Adolescent Patients about Sexual Health
A new CDC report on the drop in teen sex rates over the past 25 years has been covered by many outlets as a marked decrease. The facts however, offer a different story. Forty-four percent of female teens and 47 percent of male teens report ever having had sex, and by age 19 nearly 70 percent of teens have done so. These numbers have remained steady since 2002. They represent millions of teens that need education and skills to help them protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
As the CDC report and the No Child Left Behind reauthorization’s restrictions on sex education in schools reignites debate about comprehensive sex education, healthcare providers may be the only trusted source for a young male to get the facts.
In a recent interview, former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, PhD, likened abstinence-only education to the Tuskegee experiments, stating, “I think abstinence-only programs are really unfair . . . . What is it that justifies educating people about their bodies and leaving out things that have to deal with human sexuality? Before I was Surgeon General I had the opportunity to get President Clinton to apologize for the Tuskegee study…[T]hese black men were denied information and access to care…and now we’re talking about denying young people information that they can use to protect themselves if they decide to become sexually active.”
Take the time to talk to your young patients and let them talk to you. We ask that you take every opportunity to teach that health is indeed power!

Why I Vaccinate: Maria Trent, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advocates for creating an “HPV-free zone” through vaccination. Dr. Trent speaks to fellow healthcare providers about the importance of vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV).
Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines
In 2018 updated cervical cancer screening guidelines were issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every five years with high-risk HPV testing (hrHPV) alone as an alternative to screening every three years with Pap testing alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. The guidance also includes a recommendation for hrHPV and Pap co-testing every five years for women in the same age group.
Cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21.
Most HPV infections acquired in teens and young adults clear up spontaneously, including those caused by high-risk types. It is now recognized that screening young women soon after onset of sexual activity results in large numbers of HPV infections and Pap test abnormalities that can safely be ignored, but that historically have resulted in unnecessary treatment accompanied by preventable anxiety and stress.
For women ages 20-29, screening with cytology alone every three years
For women 30 and over:
Screening every three years with cytology alone
Screening every five years with cytology/HPV co-testing
Screening every five years with HPV testing alone
For women 65 and over: Cervical cancer screening can end for most women at age 65, provided they have a history of adequate screening tests with normal results
Post-hysterectomy: Screening is not recommended for women of any age after removal of the cervix unless there is a history of significant cervical precancer (CIN2 or higher).

Search this websiteScabies
Scabies is an infestation of the top layer of skin caused by the parasite, Sarcoptes scabiei, often called scabies or mites. The female parasite burrows under the skin and begins laying eggs within a few hours of infection and continues to lay 2 to 3 eggs daily. It takes approximately 10 days for the eggs to hatch and become adult mites. At this point, the cycle will begin again.
Scabies is transmitted through close physical contact with a person who is infected or prolonged contact with infested linens, furniture, or clothing.
FAQs
How is it transmitted?
Sexual Transmission
Scabies are transmitted through close physical contact. Transmission is more likely when partners spend the night together than during a brief sexual encounter.
Nonsexual Transmission
Sexual contact is not necessary to spread scabies. Prolonged contact between household members may allow transmission to occur. Transmission is also possible through prolonged contact with infested linens, furniture, or clothing. It is unlikely that scabies would be transmitted during casual contact (e.g. shaking hands or hugging) or contact with inanimate objects, such as a toilet seat.
The type of scabies that infest humans is specific to human beings and are different than the type that infest dogs and other animals, more commonly known as mange. Mites from animals infested with mange can burrow into human skin but cannot reproduce, and therefore die within a few days.
What are the symptoms?
Persistent itching that usually becomes worse at night.
Presence of the mite burrow(s), often in a zigzag or “S” pattern.
Presence of lesions, such as brown nodules, rashes, or pimple-like irritations.
Common sites of infestation are: webs and sides of fingers and toes, pubic and groin area, armpits, bends of elbows and knees, wrists, navel, breasts, lower portion of buttocks, penis and scrotum, waist and abdomen; rarely, they are found on the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet and the neck upward.
If a person has never been infected with scabies before, symptoms appear approximately 4 to 6 weeks after infection. If a person has been infected with scabies before, he/she will begin to experience symptoms within 1 to 4 days after infection, because of previous exposure to scabies.
A person is considered infectious from the time he/she becomes infected until treatment is successfully completed. Linens and clothing are considered infectious until treatment or until 2 weeks after the last exposure. After treatment, a person may unknowingly become re-infested through exposure to the primary source of contact or contact with a different infested source.
How is it diagnosed?
Microscopic exams of scrapings from suspicious lesion(s)
Scrapings are placed on a slide and examined under a microscope to determine whether scabies are present.
Burrow Ink Test (BIT)
The suspicious area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen. The surface is then wiped off with an alcohol pad; if the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow across the skin will appear.
Topical Tetracycline solution
A topical tetracycline solution may be applied to the suspicious area as an alternative to the BIT. The excess solution is wiped off the area with alcohol and examined under a special light to see if the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow appear.
Shave Biopsies
A very fine layer of skin is shaved off at the possible site of infestation and examined under a microscope for evidence of mites.
Needle extraction of mites
A needle is carefully inserted into the length of the burrow where the mite is likely living. The mite is then extracted with the needle and placed on a slide to be examined under a microscope.
How is it treated?
Recommended Treatment
Permethrin cream (RID®; A-200®)
The cream is applied in a thin layer to all areas of the body from the neck down.
Rinse off after 8 to 14 hours.
Alternative Treatments
Lindane (Kwell®)
The cream is applied in a thin layer to all areas of the body from the neck down.
Rinse off after 8 hours.
NOTE: Lindane (Kwell®)is potentially harmful and may cause central nervous system complications, especially in children under the age of two. Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or on broken skin. Lindane is not recommended to be used by the following people:
women who are pregnant or lactating
children under 2 years of age
people with seizure disorders
people with extensive dermatitis or known allergies to any ingredients found in Lindane.
Ivermectin
An oral treatment for scabies. The medication is taken once initially and again after two weeks.
NOTE: Ivermectin is not recommended for treatment of pregnant or lactating women. It is unknown whether Ivermectin is safe for children who weigh less than 30 pounds.
Getting Rid of Scabies
Use medication as directed.
Notify and treat all partners and household members.
Abstain from intimate or sexual contact until treatment is completed successfully.
Wash infested clothing and linen on the hot cycle setting (130 degrees Fahrenheit). Dry on hot cycle for at least 20 minutes.
Infested articles that cannot be laundered may be dry-cleaned or placed in a bag for 2 weeks to ensure decontamination.
Furniture and carpeting may be vacuumed to rid infested area of mites. Dispose of vacuum bag afterwards.
Fumigation of living areas is not necessary.
Retest for cure is advised if new burrows or rashes appear. Current rashes and itching may continue for 2-3 weeks even after successful treatment. It is recommended to reduce exposure to all STIs.
What does it mean for my health?Scabies does not usually cause anything more than discomfort and inconvenience. Occasionally, secondary bacterial infections may occur due to aggressive scratching.
Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a severe infestation of scabies. This normally occurs in people with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly and HIV-infected individuals.
How can I reduce my risk?
Avoid direct contact with infected bed linens, clothing, and furniture.
Prompt, qualified and appropriate medical intervention, treatment, and follow-up are important steps in breaking the disease cycle.
Abstain from intimate or sexual contact until treatment is successful.
Latex condoms, while not considered to be effective against scabies transmission, can prevent the transmission of other STDs.
Mutual monogamy (having sex with only 1 uninfected partner who only has sex with you) does not provide effective protection against scabies, but it is effective in preventing other STDs.
Limit the number of sexual partners to reduce exposure to all STDs

Search this websiteSyphilis
Syphilis is a curable, bacterial infection, caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. The bacteria enter the body through mucous membranes or abraded (torn or cut) skin. Once inside the body, syphilis enters the blood stream and attaches to cells, damaging organs over time.
There are four stages through which untreated syphilis progresses, each stage with its own unique signs and symptoms: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary (or late). Untreated syphilis from early to late stages can produce symptoms from 17 days up to 30+ years. While curable with antibiotics, complications that may develop in later stages cannot be reversed with treatment.
The One-Two Punch: Knocking Out HIV and Syphilis Co-infection initiative offers downloads of a video and a collection of posters and social media content to encourage individuals to talk with health care professionals about testing for both infections. Click here for free access to all campaign materials.
FAQs
How common is syphilis?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) There were 23,872 reported new cases of primary and secondary syphilis (the most infectious stages of the disease) in 2015, with the majority diagnosed in men who have sex with men (MSM).
How is it transmitted?
Sexual transmission
Syphilis transmission can occur when infected lesions come in contact with the soft skin of the mucous membrane found inside the vagina, urethra or with an abrasion during vaginal, oral and anal sex, even if there is no sexual penetration.
It is most easily spread during the first stage because symptoms usually go unnoticed.
Syphilis can also be contracted from exposure to lesions or syphilitic “warts” during the secondary stage.
If “warts” are present, they may easily spread the syphilis bacteria, due to the large amount of T. pallidumpresent.
Because symptoms of secondary syphilis can recur, a person who has entered the latency stage of syphilis can still transmit the disease.
Nonsexual transmission
Because syphilis bacteria are extremely fragile, they cannot be spread during contact with objects such as toilet seats or towels.
People, especially health care workers, can be at risk for syphilis if an abrasion or cut on the skin comes into contact with a syphilitic lesion
Mother-to-child
Syphilis can be transmitted during pregnancy or during childbirth from a mother to her infant.
What are the symptoms?
Primary Syphilis
Chancre: The primary stage of syphilis is usually marked by the appearance of a single sore, known as a chancre, within 10 to 90 days after contact with the bacteria at the site of infection. It is usually appears as a single, painless sore, that is raised or elevated.
Chancres may be found: outside the genitals, including the penis, scrotum and vagina; inside the vagina or rectum; at or around the anus; or, on the lips or in the mouth, though this is not as common. The sore can last from three to six weeks.
The chancre will go away with or without treatment. Without treatment, the person will still have syphilis and can transmit it to others.
Secondary Syphilis
The secondary stage of syphilis can develop 17 days to 6 1/2 months after infection.
Symptoms can last from 2 to 6 weeks.
Symptoms can include: a rough, reddish-brown rash that appears on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, which normally does not itch; rashes on other parts of the body, including the neck, head and torso; condylomata lata or syphilitic “warts”, moist, raised or elevated skin lesions, may be found in the anus or genital area; “mucous patches,” flat, round, grayish-white sores, can appear on the mouth, throat, and cervix; patchy loss of hair on the head and other parts of the body; or, a general sense of ill health.
Symptoms of secondary syphilis will clear up with or without treatment, but the disease will still be present if untreated. It will then enter into a latent stage, which has no signs or symptoms.
Latent Stage
Latent syphilis is defined as the time where there are no signs or symptoms of the disease
Develops from two to 30+ years after infection.
Because there are no signs or symptoms, the only way to test for infection during the latent period is by blood test.
A relapse of secondary syphilis can occur once the disease has entered the latent stage. This normally will happen during the first two years of latency.
Late Stage (Tertiary)
Symptoms of late stage or tertiary syphilis can occur 2 to 30+ years after infection.
Complications during this stage can include: gummas (small bumps or tumors that can develop on the skin, bones, liver or any other organ), problems with heart and blood vessels, or chronic nervous system disorders, such as blindness, insanity and paralysis.
If treated during this period, gummas will usually disappear. Though treatment at this phase will cure the disease and stop future damage to the body, it cannot repair or reverse the damage that occurred before treatment.
Congenital Syphilis
A mother infected with syphilis can pass the disease to her unborn child, either during pregnancy or in childbirth. A newborn infected in this manner has congenital syphilis.
Early signs generally appear from three to eight weeks after a baby is born.
Even though these symptoms develop soon after birth, most cases go unnoticed until late congenital symptoms appear in childhood or adolescence.
Late congenital syphilis has similar symptoms to tertiary syphilis in adults, though heart complications rarely occur in cases of congenital syphilis
How is it diagnosed?Syphilis can be detected by blood tests, which looks for antibodies, or by testing fluid taken from lesions or swollen lymph nodes, which occur during primary or secondary syphilis. Tests on the lymphatic fluid or lesions look for antigens.
Darkfield Exam
This test uses a fluid sample taken from the chancre during primary syphilis or from symptoms that occur during secondary syphilis found in areas such as the vagina (women) or the urethra (men). The sample is then viewed under a microscope. This test can only be done during primary or secondary syphilis, when sores, lesions & warts are present.
Blood Tests
There are two types of blood tests used to detect syphilis: nontreponemal and treponemal. These tests can be done in all stages of syphilis.
Nontreponemal blood tests are screening tests that look for certain antibodies, but not specifically syphilis antibodies. There are two types of screening test that may be used: VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagent). If the results for these test come back positive, a more specific treponemal blood test is performed to confirm a positive result. There are two types of confirmatory tests that may be used: FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption Test) or MHA-TP (Microhemagglutination-Treponema Pallidum).
There is a possibility of a false positive, particularly if the person tested has had syphilis before. A test may also be a false positive result if you are pregnant, have rheumatoid arthritis, use heroin, or have hepatitis, influenza or pneumonia.
Cerebrospinal Fluid Test
Another test uses cerebrospinal (involving the brain and spinal chord) fluid and is usually done if a person has damage to their central nervous system.
Testing in infants
If no signs and symptoms are found at birth, a blood test should be performed every 2 to 3 months on the infant until the test comes back negative. This is because an infant may test positive for syphilis and not be infected until the mother’s antibodies, transmitted during pregnancy, clear the infant’s body. For more information about testing and treatment of infants, talk with your health care provider, or visit your local health department.
How is it treated?
The preferred treatment for syphilis is penicillin. If you are allergic to penicillin, your healthcare provider can suggest another antibiotic.
If you have HIV, tell your healthcare provider. The antibiotic may not be as effective.
Penicillin is the only recommended treatment for pregnant women. If you are pregnant and are allergic to penicillin, talk to your healthcare provider. He/she can use a process called desensitization that may allow a person to take penicillin.
Infants should be checked carefully at birth. Treatment can vary for many reasons. For more information about testing and treatment of infants, talk with your healthcare provider, or visit your local health department.
Treatment Follow Up
Take all medications as directed.
All partners should be examined and treated.
Do not have sex until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured.
After treatment for primary or secondary syphilis, it is recommended that a person be retested after 6 months, and once again after a year.
If you are treated in the latent period, follow up tests are recommended after 6 months, 12 months & again at 24 months.
People who are infected with syphilis and also have HIV, should be retested every 3 months for 2 years.
What does it mean for my health?If you do not get treated, syphilis can cause blindness, paralysis, and problems with your bones and internal organs, including your heart.
How can I reduce my risk?
Abstinence (not having sex of any kind).
Mutual monogamy (having sex with only one uninfected partner).
Latex condoms for vaginal and anal sex. Condoms may protect the penis or vagina from infection, but do not protect from contact with other areas such as the scrotum or anal area.
Several barrier methods can be used to reduce the risk of transmission of syphilis during oral sex. A non-lubricated condom can be used for mouth-to-penis contact. Household plastic wrap, a dental dam, or a latex condom cut-up and opened flat can reduce the risk of transmission during mouth-to-vulva/vagina or oral-anal (rimming) contact.
How do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard, but keep in mind that some people with syphilis don’t know they have it. It’s important that you talk to your partner as soon as possible so she or he can get treatment. Also, it is possible to pass syphilis back and forth, so if you get treated and your partner doesn’t, you may get infected again.

Search this websiteSelf image
Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

Search this websiteRecognize Problems
It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

ASHA is pleased to offer a series of videos on various issues surrounding HPV, from patient counseling to HPV vaccines. Also, in a two-part series, noted researcher and leader in the STD field Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield discusses HPV screening, diagnosis and prevention.
Recommending HPV Vaccines
HPV vaccines are safe and effective, yet uptake remains low among males and females for whom vaccination is recommended. A health care provider’s recommendation – along with delivery of just three core messages- makes all the difference in parental acceptance and intention to vaccinate. This four minute video will prep you to have brief but effective conversations with parents around HPV infections and vaccines.
Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield on HPV
Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington and a leader in STD prevention and research for more than 30 years, answers common questions about HPV. In Part 1, Dr. Handsfield discusses screening, diagnosis and prevention. In Part 2, he speaks answers questions about the emotional and psychological issues surrounding an HPV diagnosis.
Part 1
Part 2
Counseling Patients on HPV
Counseling Patients about HPV is a video primer for clinicians on effective patient counseling for HPV and genital warts. The brief video includes talking points on relationships, incidence and prevalence, vaccines, and HPV’s natural history. This video was made possible by an unrestricted educational grant from Merck & Co., Inc.
HPV Vaccines and Your Patients
HPV vaccines are an important tool for HPV prevention. The video below is designed to address common questions parents and patients have about HPV vaccines.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.
Bladder—The hollow organ that stores urine.
C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

Search this websiteSTI tests? Who, me?
Follow the bouncing ball and sing along!
VD is for everybody,
Not just for the few.
Anyone can share VD,
With someone nice as you.
VD is for everybody,
Darling have no doubts!
That anyone can get VD,
That’s what…its’ all…ABOUT!!
In the late 60s, ASHA launched a PSA V.D. is for Everybody. Complete with its own catchy tune (how ‘bout them lyrics?), the spot shows a cross-section of society to drive home the point that sexually transmitted infections (STIs, or venereal diseases as they known in the day) can affect anyone.
We should probably update that to say STIs affect almost everyone…
Each year in the U.S. there are 20 million new STIs. Add each year’s new cases to those that already exist and you’re looking at about 110 million current STIs in the country.
Also, consider that experts believe more than half of all sexually active individuals have at least one infection in their lifetime with the human papillomavirus (HPV). None of this is to be alarmist or scary—the vast majority of those HPV infections are harmless and go away on their own. This is just to highlight that STIs are very common and having one means very little apart from that one is very normal.
So talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested! We don’t test nearly enough for STIs: healthcare providers and patients alike often think STIs happen to other people. Despite the fact that these infections are common and we get them from doing stuff nature pretty much intended we do, there is still so much shame and stigma we often don’t take advantage of the health care we need and deserve.
Which STIs should you consider testing for?
There’s no one size fits all approach to STI testing, so this is why it’s so important to have a conversation with your doctor or nurse to see which tests you might need; it varies based on things such as your age, gender, and risk factors. Here’s some general guidance to jumpstart your thinking:
CDC recommends everyone ages 13-64 have at least one HIV test.
Sexually active women under age 26 should have a chlamydia test each year.
At age 21, women should begin cervical cancer screening with Pap tests. Most cervical cancers are caused by certain types of HPV that, in a few cases, don’t clear on their own. The good news is that cervical cancer can be prevented!
Routine testing for common STIs is recommended for men who have sex with men. This includes annual tests for HIV, and syphilis. Also chlamydia and gonorrhea tests to check for infections of the urethra and anus (for those who’ve had insertive and/or receptive anal sex), and a test of the throat for those who’ve performed oral sex in the last year (chlamydia rarely is transmitted by oral sex so there’s no testing recommendation there).
For a drill-down on STI tests, including how they’re done and more insights into which tests you might think about having, visit our Get Tested page. Remember your medical and sexual history go a long way towards determining which STI tests you need (and just how often you should be tested), so learn more about talking with your healthcare provider and get the conversation started.

The Herpes Testing Toolkit
Genital herpes is a common viral infection, but it can be easily misdiagnosed and is often underdiagnosed. Clinicians can best serve their patients by using the correct laboratory test to provide a clear diagnosis along with providing education, reassurance, appropriate antiviral therapy, and resources for additional information and emotional support as needed.
The Herpes Testing Toolkit offers providers summary of evidence-based information and expert opinion about testing and diagnosing genital herpes. This complex and dynamic topic is organized into modules to simplify decision-making, assist with test interpretation and education and counseling.
Q&A on Herpes Testing
With newer, sophisticated DNA tests complementing type-specific blood tests and viral culture, the array of herpes simplex virus diagnostic options is more complex than ever. In this expert Q&A, Leandro Mena, MD, MPH, and James B. Brock, MD, of the University of Mississippi Medical Center explain the best uses of the different tests for herpes that are available to diagnose patients with and without symptoms.
Conversations with Herpes Experts
In this series of videos, H. Hunter Handsfield, MD, professor emeritus at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, and Kees Rietmeijer, MD, PhD, professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, discuss common questions about herpes, with a specific focus on herpes testing.
Understanding Herpes Testing
Handsfield and Rietmeijer explain the types of herpes tests available, what tests are preferred for those with or without symptoms, and what test to avoid.
Who Should Be Tested for Herpes?
Should more people be tested for herpes to know if they have it? Who should be tested? Handsfield and Rietmeijer discuss these questions.
Herpes and Pregnancy
If a woman with genital herpes has virus present in the birth canal during delivery, herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be spread to an infant, causing neonatal herpes, a serious and sometimes fatal condition. But neonatal herpes is rare, and there are steps a woman and her healthcare providers can take to reduce the risk. Handsfield and Rietmeijer lay out the concerns and discuss prevention steps.
Benefits of Herpes Testing
Are there public health benefits to offering herpes testing to more patients? Handsfield and Rietmeijer look at the possibilities while discussing the increased risk of acquiring HIV and herpes in pregnancy.

Search this websiteSelf image
Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

It’s important to know how your body works, and be able to recognize when something isn’t quite right. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked by a qualified healthcare provider.
The easiest and fastest way to recognize a problem is to perform monthly testicular exams. When you know what your body looks and feels like when it’s healthy, you’ll know it’s time to get checked if you detect any change at all.
Testicular cancer and hernias
Although rare, testicular cancer is the second most common cancer seen during the teen years.
Hernias, on the other hand, are quite common in teens. A hernia is simply a weakness in the abdominal wall. Sometimes a piece of intestine can become trapped in the scrotum, cutting off the blood supply to the intestine. It can cause serious problems if the situation isn’t quickly corrected.
Both conditions can produce lumps or bumps, which is why it’s important to perform testicular self-exams. If you notice anything unusual, get checked.
You don’t have to have a symptom to get checked. If you’re sexually active or even thinking about becoming sexually active, schedule a testicular exam with your health care provider. He or she will examine you to determine what “normal” is for you.
Once a baseline has been established, any changes in your body will be noticeable and easier to diagnose. If an abnormality exists, it can be treated. If a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is detected, it can be treated and prevented from spreading to others.
What to expect with a testicular exam
Many healthcare providers perform a testicular exam as part of a patient’s annual checkup. It’s quick and painless. Your doctor will look for lumps and bumps, swelling, hardening or enlargement of the testicles. And yes, the doctor will have to touch you “down there.” You may be embarrassed or even have an erection, but both responses are so common that healthcare providers are unfazed by either reaction. If it is your first exam, you may want to mention that; many doctors will explain things to you step-by-step, show you how to perform a self-exam and answer all your questions.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
If you are sexually active, you have to protect yourself from diseases and infections. Obviously, the best protection is abstinence, but if you are having sexual intercourse, use a condom every time.
Using a condom doesn’t mean you can forget about sexual health. You still need to be vigilant and consistent about self-exams. Remember, many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t cause symptoms in women. By the time you notice a symptom, you may have already infected your partner(s).
If you notice a change to your genitals, such as:
Sores, ulcers, blisters or warts
A burning sensation when you pee
A heavy feeling in the testicles
Lumps or bumps
Swelling, redness or a rash
Itching or visible lice or eggs in the pubic hair
Discharge from the penis other than semen and urine
Or if you notice a problem with the following:
Unusual fever, fatigue, nausea
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
Night sweats, diarrhea, weight loss, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases
… get checked.
Having a symptom doesn’t mean you have a disease. The symptoms are so many and varied, it’s hard to tell if, for example, you have a raging case of jock itch or… scabies. Get checked anyway.
Each year, one of every four sexually active teens will get a sexually transmitted infection. By age 25, half of all youth will have acquired one or more infections.
Bottom line? Pay attention to your body and how it works. Make sure a qualified healthcare provider is tracking your reproductive health. If something changes or doesn’t seem quite right, get checked. Above all, respect your body by protecting it from infection, disease and neglect.

While patients have a clear need for sexual health information, and look to healthcare providers as the most trusted resource, a significant number of medical schools lack formal sexual health training. According to a recent survey of medical students in the U.S., more than two-thirds of students (68.8%) indicated that that addressing and treating sexual concerns will be an important part of their future careers, but only 37.6% felt they have received adequate training to do so.
The American Medical Students Association (ASMA) offers resources for medical students looking to learn more about sexual health issues and how to improve sexual health curricula.
Resources from ASMA
Sexual Health Leadership Program
In 2009, AMSA launched the Sexual Health Leadership Program to begin to address the lack of attitudes, knowledge, and skills training of American medical students in sexual health education. The online course includes lectures by experts, discussions among participants, various media, and collaborative projects.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.
Dysuria—Painful or difficult urination. Dysuria may be due to an STD/STI.

The issues are complex and not always easy to discuss but there is a strong need to ensure healthy dialogue on issues of sexuality, sexual health, and responsible sexual behaviors.  While much attention is focused on adolescents and adverse outcomes of sexual activity, it’s also important to create opportunities for sex positive discussion that goes beyond adolescents and young adults.
As journalists, you strive to provide the latest, most accurate information about sexual health to your readers, listeners, viewers and visitors.
The American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), founded in 1914, is the oldest national nonprofit with a central mission of addressing sexuality across a spectrum that recognizes the rich diversity of sexual functioning and expression in our society. This touches on a variety of issues including access to reproductive health care, the rights of sexual minorities, comprehensive sexual education for young people, consent and agency over one’s body, and the importance of sex, pleasure, and healthy relationships in our overall health and quality of life.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) also are an area of focus for ASHA, given there are nearly 20 million new cases of STIs every year in the United States, and experts believe the majority of sexually active individuals will have one or more STIs in their lifetimes (though many cases are never diagnosed or recognized).
In an effort to fulfill its commitment to better public health, ASHA reaches out with a variety of tools: hotlines, media campaigns, printed materials, community-based projects, support groups, research and advocacy efforts. ASHA provides up-to-date, factual information to more than 13,000 people every day.
We believe strongly that journalists play an important role in helping ASHA educate the public about STIs. By contacting ASHA, you can get background information on STIs or reach a content expert.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.

Most people think they would know if they had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) . . . wrong!
The truth is a person can have an STIs but have no signs or symptoms. Or they may have mild signs that can be easily overlooked. This is why the term “disease” (as in STD) is starting to be replaced by infection (or STI). The only way to know if you have an STI is to get tested.
Lots of people are confused about getting tested for STIs. For example, you may think your annual medical check-up will include tests for STIs, especially if your healthcare provider knows you are sexually active. The fact is that some providers might test for some infections when you come in for a regular check-up, while others do not test for any STI unless you ask them to.
If you’ve had unprotected sex, have a new partner (or more than one partner), or for any reason are worried you have been exposed to an STI, talk to your healthcare provider about getting tested be tested for these leading common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, herpes, HPV, syphilis and trichomoniasis. If your healthcare provider feels you do not need to be checked for some of these, you will at least know which ones you were tested for and which ones you were not.
Where can I get tested?
You can talk to your healthcare provider about testing, or you can search for a clinic near you using the search tool below (provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Just enter your zip code to find a local testing site.
ZIP Code:
How do STI tests work?
Getting tested can be quick and easy. Depending on what you are being tested for, your provider may take a blood sample, a swab, or ask you to pee in a cup. Easy! Here’s an idea of what to expect:
Chlamydia
How the test is done: Swab of genital area or urine sample
What you also need to know: If you have had oral or anal sex, let your healthcare provider know this also. These sites may be infected, but vaginal or urine samples may not be positive.
Gonorrhea
How the test is done: Swab of genital area or urine sample
What you also need to know: Like with gonorrhea, if you have had oral or anal sex, let your healthcare provider know this also. These sites may be infected, but vaginal or urine samples may not be positive
HIV
How the test is done: Blood test or swab from inside of mouth
What you also need to know: Confidential and anonymous testing options are available in many clinics
Genital herpes(no symptoms)
How the test is done: Blood test (drawn from arm or a fingerstick)
What you also need to know: Be sure to ask for a type-specific IgG test (not an IgM test)
Genital herpes (with symptoms)
How the test is done: Swab of affected area; if at first negative for herpes, follow later with blood test to make sure.
What you also need to know: Must be done as soon as possible; “viral culture” test not as accurate after 48 hours. A negative culture does not mean that you do not have genital herpes.
Syphilis
How the test is done: Blood test, or sample taken from a sore.
What you also need to know: The CDC recommends all pregnant women be tested for syphilis
Trichomoniasis
How the test is done: Swab of infected area, physical exam or sample of discharge.
What you also need to know: “Trich” is harder to detect in men than in women
HPV (genital warts)
How the test is done: Visual diagnosis
What you also need to know: Warts can occur in both men and women.
HPV (cervical cancer)
How the test is done: If Pap test result is abnormal, HPV DNA test and a biopsy may be done
What you also need to know: Pap tests detect cervical cell changes, not HPV. An abnormal test is often caused by HPV infection. No test available for men for these types of HPV.
What tests are recommended for you?
What should you get tested for? When? How often? Below are testing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While these guidelines are general ones, you are an individual. Your healthcare provider may have different recommendations based on your individual health status and history, of course.
Who should get tested for:
STDs/STIs in generalCDC guidelines don’t suggest routine STD/STI testing if you don’t have any symptoms. However, CDC does recommend routine testing for men who have sex with men. If you are entering a new relationship and are interested in general testing, know that not all doctors perform the same tests for STD/STIs. Learn which tests you need and which you might have to ask for.
ChlamydiaCDC recommends yearly chlamydia testing of all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors for chlamydial infections (those who have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners), and all pregnant women. Men should speak with their healthcare provider if they are at risk for chlamydia and if testing is recommended. Testing is a simple as peeing in a cup.
GonorrheaCDC recommends yearly gonorrhea screening for all sexually active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection.
HIVThe CDC recommends at least one HIV test for everyone aged 13 to 64 who visits a doctor. Most HIV is transmitted by the 25% of infected people who do not realize they are infected.
Cervical cancerPap tests, as a cervical cancer screening tool, are recommend for women beginning at age 21. Women age 30 and over are recommended to have an HPV test along with their Pap.
Breast cancerCDC recommends mammograms for women every one or two years starting at age 40.
Or another way to look at screening is . . .
What testing is recommended for . . .?
Women younger than 25 years oldCDC recommends yearly chlamydia and gonorrhea testing of all sexually active women younger than 25 years.
Women age 21 and olderPap tests, as a cervical cancer screening tool, are recommend for women beginning at age 21.
Men who have sex with menMen who have sex with men should talk to their healthcare providers about general STD/STI screening.
Everyone age 13 to 64The CDC recommends at least one HIV test for everyone aged 13 to 64 who visits a doctor. Most HIV is transmitted by the 25% of infected people who do not realize they are infected.

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending hepatitis C testing for everyone born from 1945 – 1965. While anyone can get Hepatitis C, Baby Boomers are five times more likely to be infected. CDC’s Know More Hepatitis campaign addresses this issue head on. The goal of this national, theory-driven multi-media education campaign is to ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with Hepatitis C by increasing testing among baby boomers so those who are infected can get linked to life-saving care.
According to the CDC, the reason for the high rates of hepatitis C in this age group is not completely understood. Most boomers are believed to have become infected in the 1970s and 1980s when rates of hepatitis C were the highest. Since people with hepatitis C can live for decades without symptoms, many boomers are unknowingly living with an infection they got many years ago.
The only way for someone to know if they are infected with hepatitis C is to get tested. For this reason, CDC encourages hepatitis C screening for everyone born between 1945-1965. The Know More Hepatitis campaign website has a range of material you can share with your patients that explain the risk to patients and promote the importance of testing.
Download a range of patient education materials—fact sheets, posters, and more—from the campaign pages at CDC.

Search this websiteTrichomoniasis
Trichomoniasis (also called trich) is a common, curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasitic protozoa called Trichomonas vaginalis. More than one million new cases occur each year in the U.S.
Trichomoniasis may cause symptoms in women, but most men do not have symptoms. You may need to talk to your healthcare provider about whether or not you should be tested. If you have trichomoniasis, you are more likely to contract HIV if you are exposed–so getting tested and treated is important.
FAQs
How does someone get trich?Trich is spread through sexual contact with an infected partner: this includes penis-to-vagina intercourse or genital-to-genital contact.
What are the symptoms of trich?Only about 30 percent of people that have trichomoniasis develop any symptoms. When trich does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation.
Symptoms of trichomoniasis are more common in women. These include:
Vaginal discharge that is green, yellow or grey
A bad vaginal smell
Itching in or around the vagina
Pain during sex
Pain when urinating
Most men don’t have symptoms of trich but when they do, symptoms can include itching or irritation inside the penis, a discharge or pain when urinating.
Some people with symptoms of trich get them within 5 to 28 days after being infected, but others do not develop symptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go, and without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years.
How can trich be prevented?Using latex condoms correctly every time during sexual intercourse will help reduce the risk of getting or spreading trichomoniasis.
How is trich diagnosed?It is not possible to diagnose trichomoniasis based on symptoms alone (remember–many people don’t have symptoms). A healthcare provider must perform a test to diagnose trich.
The parasite is harder to detect in men than in women. General tips for women to help their provider find out what they may have include:
Schedule the exam when you’re not having your monthly period.
Don’t douche 24 hours before your exam.
Don’t use vaginal sprays 24 hours before your exam.
If you have sex less than 24 hours before the exam, use condoms.
Healthcare providers often diagnose trich in women by putting a sample of vaginal fluid or discharge on a slide (called a “wet preparation”) and viewing the parasite under a microscope. This test is not always reliable.
A culture test is another method to detect trich, and can be used with males and females. Culture tests use urine, or a swab from the vagina or urethra, and make the trich parasite easier to find by “growing” it in a lab.
Recently, tests that are much more accurate have become available, including DNA tests that are reliable in men and women. These tests can be done with vaginal swabs or urine. Women may have a trich test done along with a pelvic exam. One of these tests even allows healthcare providers to check for trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea using the same sample.
How is trich treated?Trichomoniasis is curable with antibiotics, typically metronidazole (Flagyl) or Tinidazole (Tindamax). If you are being treated for trichomoniosis, keep these facts in mind:
Use all the medicine prescribed, even if your symptoms go away
Sex partners must also be treated, or you will get trich again
Do not have sex until all partners have finished the medication
What if I have trich while pregnant?Trichomoniasis can cause babies to be born early or with low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds). If you think you may be pregnant – or are planning to become pregnant-be sure to talk to your healthcare provider and ask about testing for trich. Women in the first three months of pregnancy should not take medicine for trich because it might hurt the baby. You can take medicine after the first three months.
Are there other complications with trich?Trich can cause genital inflammation that makes it easier to become infected with the HIV virus or to pass the HIV virus on to a sex partner.
ASHA Survey Shows Most Women Unaware of Trich
Even though trich is the most common curable sexually transmitted Infection (STI), a new survey conducted by ASHA in January-February 2013 shows that only one in five (22%) women are familiar with it.
As illustrated below, women surveyed perceive trich as the least common STI, when in reality there are more total (new and existing) cases of trich in the U.S. (estimated 3.7 million) as there are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea combined.

The CDC recommends that any sexually active woman seeking treatment for vaginal discharge should be tested for trich. However, 65% of women surveyed would not seek medical attention if they experienced unusual symptoms, instead waiting to see if the symptoms go away or treating themselves with over-the-counter medicine.
Pregnant women with trich are more likely to have preterm or low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds) babies. Trich also increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Among women surveyed who were concerned about contracting an STD, nearly half (49%) worry about trich increasing their risk of HIV.
ASHA recommends that women encourage their partners to get tested, as 1 in 5 people can be reinfected within three months of treatment. According to the survey, 63% of women cite having only one sex partner as a reason they would not get tested for trich. Yet a woman can be at risk for trich even if she only has one sexual partner.

Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.

Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.

Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.

Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.

Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

Search this websiteSelf image
Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

Currently, male condoms are the only widely available, proven method for reducing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during intercourse. Organizations around the world recommend condom use for the prevention of pregnancy and HIV/STIs.
While not as widely available, female condoms also offer protection against unintended pregnancy and STIs. Female condoms offer women greater control over contraception and STI prevention.
ASHA supports the promotion and use of condoms to limit the spread of STIs and their harmful consequences. Condoms are effective when people use them correctly and consistently.
The surest way to avoid transmission of STIs is to abstain from sexual intercourse or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is not infected with any sexually transmitted infections. People who choose to be sexually active must have access to information and options to reduce their risk.
Male condoms: DOs and DON’Ts
CONDOM DOs:
DO use only latex or polyurethane (plastic) condoms.
DO keep condoms in a cool, dry place.
DO put the condom on an erect (hard) penis before there is any contact with a partner’s genitals.
DO use plenty of lubricant with latex condoms if you find vaginal sex is uncomfortable, or that condoms tend to rip or tear. Don’t use oil-based products with latex condoms (see DON’TS for more on this). Water-based lubes are condom-friendly but might increase the risks of STIs with anal sex. Consider using silicone-based lubricants for anal intercourse.
DO hold the condom in place at the base of the penis before withdrawing (pulling out) after sex.
DO throw the condom away after it’s been used.
CONDOM DON’Ts:
DON’T use out of date condoms. Check the expiration date carefully. Old condoms can be dry, brittle or weakened and can break more easily.
DON’T unroll the condom before putting it on the erect penis.
DON’T leave condoms in hot places like your wallet or in your car.
DON’T use oil-based products, like baby or cooking oils, hand lotion or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline®) as lubricants with latex condoms. The oil quickly weakens latex and can cause condoms to break.
DON’T use your fingernails or teeth when opening a condom wrapper. It’s very easy to tear the condom inside. If you do tear a condom while opening the wrapper, throw that condom away and get a new one.
DON’T reuse a condom. Always use a new condom for each kind of sex you have.
DON’T regularly use lubricants with spermicide called nonoxynol-9 (“N-9”) as they may cause skin irritation or tiny abrasions that make the genital skin more susceptible to STIs.

Donate Stock

Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Search this websiteHepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is estimated that between 125,000 and 200,000 people are infected with hepatitis A each year in the United States. Between 84,000 to 134,000 of of those people will show symptoms of hepatitis A virus (HAV). Each year, approximately 100 people will die because of hepatitis A.
FAQs
How is it transmitted?Hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through oral contact with feces (oral-fecal contact). This includes contaminated food or water sources and sexual contact, especially oral-anal sex.
Hepatitis A can easily spread among young children in day care settings because many are in diapers and cannot wash their own hands, and no one may know they have the disease since children normally do not have symptoms.
Hepatitis A has on rare occasions been transmitted through blood transfusion, use of blood products or sharing needles or other injecting equipment contaminated with HAV-infected blood. Transmission by blood is rare because the presence of virus in the blood occurs with the onset of infection and is not thought to be present long.
What are the symptoms?Most adults infected with hepatitis A usually develop some symptoms. Symptoms may develop about 15-50 days after exposure; the average is 28 days. These may include:
Low-grade fever
Malaise (feeling of ill-health)
Fatigue (feeling tired all the time)
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Abdominal discomfort
Dark-colored urine
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
Children under 6 years of age seldom develop symptoms, although some may experience diarrhea.
How is hepatitis diagnosed?There are currently three blood tests available to detect HAV antibodies (disease-fighting proteins in the blood). Antibodies may be detected for up to six months after symptoms begin. HAV antibodies usually disappear after this time. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information about HAV testing.
How is hepatitis A treated?There is no cure for hepatitis A. Most people with severe infection will experience short-term illness and then recover completely. They are often told to rest for one to four weeks and to avoid intimate contact with others. Some doctors recommend a high-protein, low-fat diet during recovery and suggest patients avoid alcohol, sedatives, or strong painkillers. Once recovered, an individual is immune and will not get hepatitis A again.
What does it mean for my health?Fortunately, complications from hepatitis A are rare, and few deaths result from it. It is not known to cause chronic infections. However, it can make some people very sick, and it is easily preventable.
Is there a vaccine to prevent hepatitis A?Yes! Hepatitis A is preventable by vaccination. Clinical trials have shown that the vaccine is effective in preventing infection in about 95% of people who were exposed. There are generally no side effects, except for soreness at the site of injection. Less than 10% of those vaccinated become tired and nauseous.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis A vaccination for:
All children
Men who have sex with men
Illegal drug users
Others recommended for hepatitis A vaccine:
Anyone traveling to an area with a high prevalence of hepatitis A
Those with hepatitis B or C
How can I protect myself against hepatitis A?Sexual Prevention: Besides vaccination, there are other ways to protect yourself against sexual transmission of hepatitis A:
Abstinence (not having sex)
Mutual monogamy (having sex with only one uninfected partner)
Cut-up non-lubricated latex condoms or use of other moisture barriers, such as household plastic wrap or dams (square pieces of latex) can reduce the risk of transmitting HAV during oral-anal sex.
Non-Sexual Prevention: Other ways to prevent hepatitis A:
Avoid sharing drug needles and other drug-injection equipment.
Avoid contaminated food or water sources
Practicing good personal hygiene, especially hand-washing after using the toilet or changing diapers
To inactivate HAV, heat foods at temperatures above 185 degrees Fahrenheit for 1 minute or disinfect surfaces with a 1:100 dilution of household bleach in tap water (1 part bleach for 100 parts of water)
How can I talk to my partner?If you have tested positive for hepatitis A, you may want to tell to your sex partner(s) that you have the virus. As part of good partner communication, deciding to use latex condoms and moisture barriers during sexual contact helps reduce the risk of transmitting a sexually transmitted disease. Hepatitis A can be transmitted through oral-anal sex so it is recommended to always use safer sex methods to reduce the risk of transmission.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reported rates of primary and secondary syphilis in 2015 were the highest in more than 20 years. While gay and bisexual men face the greatest burden, during 2014-2015 syphilis rates increased in every region, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity. Syphilis has increased among women in recent year, and the rate of reported congenital syphilis has increased each year during 2012–2015.
In response to these rising syphilis rates, CDC recently released the CDC Call to Action: Let’s Work Together to Stem the Tide of Rising Syphilis in the United States. This resource offers action steps for healthcare providers, public health departments and more, with specific steps healthcare providers can take to reduce congenital syphilis and syphilis among men who have sex with men.
The One-Two Punch: Knocking Out HIV and Syphilis Co-infection initiative offers downloads of a video and a collection of posters and social media content to encourage individuals to talk with health care professionals about testing for both infections. Click here for free access to all campaign materials.
The video below from CDC walks healthcare providers through the three key actions that they can take to help reverse the rising syphilis rates: Talk, Test, and Treat.

Search this websiteMenopause
Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

Ambassadors are willing to start conversations about taboo topics and are passionate about creating a sexually healthy nation. They use social media as a platform for sharing important sexual health information. Want to see what ASHA ambassadors are doing? Check out the hashtag #ISpeakSexHealth across all Social Media Platforms!
If you want to play a vital role in creating a sexually healthy nation then ASHA’s Volunteer Ambassador Program is the place for you. Volunteering as an ambassador is super easy but is an extremely important component of ASHA. Twice a week, ASHA Ambassadors are sent content that they can choose to share onto their own social media platforms. This allows ASHA to expand our audience by getting sexual health information out into a variety of social networks that may otherwise never receive it! In addition, we periodically have other opportunities for people to get more involved in the work that ASHA is doing.

Your self-image is your mental picture of yourself, both as a physical body and a person. This mental picture is important to your wellbeing. A healthy body image means that you see yourself as you really are, and that you feel good in your own skin. Self-image also involves your emotions about your strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Because sex involves both the body and the mind, our self-image can have a strong affect on our sexual health.
It’s important to realize – and remind yourself every day – that, just as you have a unique mind with its own gifts to offer the world, you also have a unique body that is one-of-a-kind. This is important to remember if you’re feeling self-conscious about the way you look. Valuing and respecting your own body is a crucial part of a healthy sexual life (and a healthy life in general)!
The Influence of Media
Images in the media don’t usually show the realistic bodies that we all have. To make products seem more appealing, models or spokespeople are often edited, even beyond recognition. This is not just limited to advertising. On social media, apps like FaceTune or photoshop are often used by ordinary people to change parts of their faces or bodies. It’s so hard to know what’s real!
Because of this, it’s important to not compare yourself to the images that we see online. Think about what you like about your body. What’s your favorite feature? What are your favorite activities? Your body makes it possible for you to do these things. Some examples might be: “I really like the way my cheeks look when I smile” or “I’m glad I have strong legs so that I can bike as far as I can” or as simple as “I’m glad that I can communicate with my mouth”.
The more you actively value your own unique qualities, the easier it is to think about your body as an extension of the amazing personal traits that you possess. If you routinely struggle with this or if your self-image feels overwhelmingly negative, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about how to get help.
Vaginal Self Image
For a lot of women, it is difficult to know what is considered an attractive or even a normal vulva. But, as long as you are able to use the bathroom, menstruate, and engage in sexual activity that you are looking for, your vulva is normal. Abrupt changes like bumps or irritation are cause for concern. But, otherwise, your vulva is beautiful and uniquely yours. There is a lot of variety in the shapes, colors, and textures of labia, clitorises, and even vaginal openings. The texture and feeling your vulva and your vagina will also change as you age, especially if you choose to have children. Long term changes to your vagina and vulva are also normal and to be expected. Increased vaginal dryness is a common example that can often be solved with lubricant.
What are some common female sexual difficulties?
Self Image as We Age
As women get older, our bodies experience new changes. For some women, it can be difficult to maintain their positive self image as their lives and bodies change. But, it is important to continue to remind yourself of the amazing things that your body can do.
Menopause is a transition that can be additionally challenging. Your body chemistry may shift very abruptly, and it can be difficult to deal with the emotional changes that can accompany the physical ones. The process of aging, too, brings on new feelings and experiences that can affect your sexual life and your self-perception.
When it comes down to it, a woman’s physical body is constantly changing. Actively learning about what to expect as you age can help you prepare for the feelings that those changes may bring. Don’t hesitate to ask your health care provider about what you should be watching for as your body goes through the stages of life. Remember that your body is an amazing thing; it is capable of showing love, giving and receiving pleasure, and experiencing new things!

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

ASHA is pleased to offer a series of videos on various issues surrounding HPV, from patient counseling to HPV vaccines. Also, in a two-part series, noted researcher and leader in the STD field Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield discusses HPV screening, diagnosis and prevention.
Recommending HPV Vaccines
HPV vaccines are safe and effective, yet uptake remains low among males and females for whom vaccination is recommended. A health care provider’s recommendation – along with delivery of just three core messages- makes all the difference in parental acceptance and intention to vaccinate. This four minute video will prep you to have brief but effective conversations with parents around HPV infections and vaccines.
Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield on HPV
Dr. H. Hunter Handsfield, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington and a leader in STD prevention and research for more than 30 years, answers common questions about HPV. In Part 1, Dr. Handsfield discusses screening, diagnosis and prevention. In Part 2, he speaks answers questions about the emotional and psychological issues surrounding an HPV diagnosis.
Part 1
Part 2
Counseling Patients on HPV
Counseling Patients about HPV is a video primer for clinicians on effective patient counseling for HPV and genital warts. The brief video includes talking points on relationships, incidence and prevalence, vaccines, and HPV’s natural history. This video was made possible by an unrestricted educational grant from Merck & Co., Inc.

Search this websiteMenopause
Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

Ambassadors are willing to start conversations about taboo topics and are passionate about creating a sexually healthy nation. They use social media as a platform for sharing important sexual health information. Want to see what ASHA ambassadors are doing? Check out the hashtag #ISpeakSexHealth across all Social Media Platforms!
If you want to play a vital role in creating a sexually healthy nation then ASHA’s Volunteer Ambassador Program is the place for you. Volunteering as an ambassador is super easy but is an extremely important component of ASHA. Twice a week, ASHA Ambassadors are sent content that they can choose to share onto their own social media platforms. This allows ASHA to expand our audience by getting sexual health information out into a variety of social networks that may otherwise never receive it! In addition, we periodically have other opportunities for people to get more involved in the work that ASHA is doing.

Glossary E-I
Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

C
Cancer—A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.
Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.
Cell culture—A diagnostic test for many kinds of viruses. In a cell culture for HSV, a swab of the patient’s herpes lesion is placed in a dish containing normal skin cells to see if HSV will grow.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—The federal public health agency serving as the center for preventing, tracking, controlling and investigating the epidemiology of AIDS and other diseases.
Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.

Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

While patients have a clear need for sexual health information, and look to healthcare providers as the most trusted resource, a significant number of medical schools lack formal sexual health training. According to a recent survey of medical students in the U.S., more than two-thirds of students (68.8%) indicated that that addressing and treating sexual concerns will be an important part of their future careers, but only 37.6% felt they have received adequate training to do so.
The American Medical Students Association (ASMA) offers resources for medical students looking to learn more about sexual health issues and how to improve sexual health curricula.

Sexual Health Leadership Program
In 2009, AMSA launched the Sexual Health Leadership Program to begin to address the lack of attitudes, knowledge, and skills training of American medical students in sexual health education. The online course includes lectures by experts, discussions among participants, various media, and collaborative projects.

A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.

Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.

Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.

Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

Ambassadors are willing to start conversations about taboo topics and are passionate about creating a sexually healthy nation. They use social media as a platform for sharing important sexual health information. Want to see what ASHA ambassadors are doing? Check out the hashtag #ISpeakSexHealth across all Social Media Platforms!
If you want to play a vital role in creating a sexually healthy nation then ASHA’s Volunteer Ambassador Program is the place for you. Volunteering as an ambassador is super easy but is an extremely important component of ASHA. Twice a week, ASHA Ambassadors are sent content that they can choose to share onto their own social media platforms. This allows ASHA to expand our audience by getting sexual health information out into a variety of social networks that may otherwise never receive it! In addition, we periodically have other opportunities for people to get more involved in the work that ASHA is doing.

Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.

Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy.

Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.

Questions? Please call us at 800-552-4375.
Memorial and Tribute Donations
Make a gift in honor or in memory of someone special. This is a unique and wonderful way to acknowledge them. A letter will be sent to his or her family to inform them of your generous gift, though the amount of your contribution will remain confidential.
Endowment Fund
A gift toward ASHA’s endowment helps ensure that the American Sexual Health Association can provide services to the current as well as future generations.

Workplace Campaigns
Does your employer participate in a United Way Campaign, a State Employees Combined Campaign or the Combined Federal Campaign? ASHA benefits from campaigns throughout the country and we thank you for your ongoing support! If your company participates in a United Way campaign, simply designate ASHA on your giving form.

Donate Stock
Electronic Transfer: The most common method of gifting Securities to the American Sexual Health Association involves your broker electronically transferring shares. Shares can be transferred to ASHA via Charles Schwab. ASHA’s account number is 4973-9917 and our DTC number is 0164. Typically a letter of instruction—signed by the account owner—is the only required documentation needed. The letter of instruction should include ASHA’s DTC number and account number.

Physical Transfer: You can forward your stock certificate(s) directly to ASHA. Each stock certificate requires a stock power form.

Planned Gifts
What are planned gifts? Planned gifts include gifts through your will (bequest), gifts of life insurance and charitable trusts.
Bequest: Many of our supporters make charitable gifts by naming the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary in their wills. The federal government encourages these gifts or bequests, by allowing an unlimited estate tax charitable deduction. There are three different types of bequests:
Specific Bequest: You designate a specific dollar amount, specific percentage, or specific property to the American Sexual Health Association.
Residual Bequest: Your estate will pay all debts, taxes, expenses, and specific bequests. The remaining amount will be transferred to the American Sexual Health Association.
Contingent Bequest: You can ask that the American Sexual Health Association receive all or a portion of your estate only under certain circumstances. For example, you can name the American Sexual Health Association as a beneficiary of your estate only if there are no surviving close family members. Childless couples sometimes provide for the entire estate to go to the surviving spouse, or if the spouse does not survive, to the American Sexual Health Association.
Gift of Life Insurance: Some supporters donate life insurance policies that were purchased years ago to provide for children or other family members and are no longer needed.
If you have already made a plan to give to the American Sexual Health Association in your will or estate plan, please contact us. We realize that with your special gift, you consider us to be part of your family, and we want to do our best to keep you informed as to how your gift will be used and to give you the opportunity to tell us of your wishes.

Glossary J-Q
Glossary R-Z
A
Abdomen—The part of the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, reproductive organs, and other organs.
Abstinence—Choosing not to have any kind of sexual activity. Someone who practices sexual abstinence does not run any risk of contracting a STD/STI or having an unwanted pregnancy. See also selective abstinence.
Acute—Refers to intense, short-term symptoms or illnesses that either resolve or evolve into long-lasting, chronic disease manifestations.
Acyclovir—An antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (fever blisters, cold sores), herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), and herpes zoster (shingles); and used in the suppression of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Acyclovir comes in the form of pills, ointment or injection. The drug functions as a nucleoside analog, but must be converted to an active (phosphated) form by the thymidine kinase enzyme produced only by cells infected by certain herpes viruses, including varicella zoster virus (shingles) and herpes simplex-1 and -2. Acyclovir causes few side effects–occasionally nausea, diarrhea or headaches.
Alternative Medicine—A catch-all phrase for a long list of treatments or medicinal systems including traditional systems such as Chinese medicine, homeopathy, various herbals and other miscellaneous treatments that have not been accepted by the mainstream, or Western, medical establishment. Alternative medicine is also referred to as complementary medicine. The designation “alternative medicine” is not equivalent to “holistic medicine,” which is a more narrow term. See Holistic Medicine.
Anal sex—When a man puts his penis in another person’s anus. This is also called anal intercourse.
Analgesic—Refers to a compound that reduces pain. Aspirin and the opiates are examples of analgesic drugs.
Antibiotic—A substance, especially one similar to those produced by certain fungi for destroying bacteria, that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. An antibiotic is used to combat disease and infection.
Antibody—A disease-fighting protein in the blood created by the immune system.
Antiretroviral—A substance that stops or suppresses the activity of a retrovirus such as HIV.
Anus—The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Asymptomatic—Without signs or symptoms of disease or illness.
Asymptomatic transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of virus from one person to another during a time when a person has no signs or symptoms.
Autoinoculation—The spread of a microorganism such as a virus from one part the body to another.
Autoinoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)—The spread of HSV from one part of the body to another. This can result when a person with active herpes deposits a significant amount of virus onto some other vulnerable part of the body–most often a mucous membrane.
B
Bacterial STD/STI—An STD/STI caused by a bacteria, such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Bacterial STDs/STIs respond effectively to antibiotic treatment, yet they remain epidemic in the population.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)—The most prevalent cause of vaginal symptoms among women of childbearing age, BV, previously called nonspecific vaginitis, is characterized by a strong fishy odor and a gray, watery discharge.
Balanitis—An inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Men with uncontrolled diabetes are at risk of developing balanitis.
Balanoposthitis—Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.
bDNA (branched DNA) — A test developed by the Chiron Corp. for measuring the amount of HIV (as well as other viruses) in blood plasma. bDNA is similar in results but not in technique to the PCR test.
Benign—Not cancerous; does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.
Biopsy—The removal of a sample of tissue that is then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
Birth control—Used to refer to contraception.
Bisexual—A term to refer to a person who is sexually attracted to both males and females.

Candida—A group of yeast-like fungi, in particular Candida albicans, that infect the mouth as well as other mucous membranes in the esophagus, intestines, vagina, throat and lungs. Oral or recurrent vaginal candida infection is an early sign of immune system deterioration.
Candidiasis—An infection due to candida yeast. The symptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) and vaginal candidiasis (formerly called monilia) include pain, itching, redness and white patches in their respective sites. Some common treatments are clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole.
Carcinoma—Cancer that begins in the lining or covering of an organ.
Carcinoma in situ—Cancer that involves only the cells in which it began and that has not spread to other tissues.
Catheter—A flexible tube that is placed in a body cavity to insert or withdraw fluids.
Cauterization—The use of heat to destroy abnormal cells. Also called diathermy or electrodiathermy.
CD4—The protein structure on the surface of a human cell that allows HIV to attach, enter, and thus infect a cell. CD4 receptors are present on CD4 cells (helper T-cells), macrophages and dendritic cells, among others. Normally, CD4 acts as an accessory molecule, forming part of larger structures (such as the T-cell receptor) through which T-cells and other cells signal each other.
CD4 Cell—A type of T-cell involved in protecting against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Other names for CD4 cell are T-helper cell or helper T-cell.
CD4 Cell Count—The most commonly used surrogate marker for assessing the state of the immune system. As CD4 cell count declines, the risk of developing opportunistic infections increases.
Celibate—Choosing not to have sex or abstaining from sex.

Cervical Dysplasia—An abnormal tissue growth on the cervix which may progress to cancer if not treated in time. Cervical dysplasia is detected through a Pap test.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia — A general term for the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Numbers from 1 to 3 may be used to describe how much of the cervix contains abnormal cells. Also called CIN.
Cervix—The lower, cylindrical end of the uterus that forms a narrow canal connecting the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of a women’s reproductive tract.
Chancroid — A highly contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by the Hemophilus ducreyi bacterium. It appears as a pimple, chancre, sore or ulcer on the skin of the genitals. The lesion appears after an incubation period of three to five days and may facilitate the transmission of HIV.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with anticancer drugs.
Chronic—Refers to symptoms and diseases that last for an extended period of time without noticeable change.
CIN—See Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
Circumcision—A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis.
Clinical—Refers to physical signs and symptoms directly observable in the human body.
Clinical Trial—A study done to test an experimental medicine in human beings to see if it is safe and effective.
Clitoris—A female sexual organ found where the labia minora, or inner lips of the vagina, meet, partially hidden by the labia. It is highly sensitive, and can be a source of sexual pleasure and female orgasm.
CMV—See Cytomegalovirus
Cold sores—Otherwise known as “fever blisters” and herpes type-1 infection.
Colposcopy—A procedure in which the vagina and the surface of the uterine cervix is examined through a lighted microscope (colposcope) for signs of cervical dysplasia or cancer. Colposcopy is a more accurate alternative to Pap smears, but requires considerably more skill to perform.
Come out — The usually voluntary public revealing of a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Complementary Medicine—Non-mainstream health care provided in addition or instead of standard medical practice. See also Alternative Medicine.
Condom—Male: A cover for the penis, worn during sex to prevent STDs and pregnancy. Only a latex condom is recommended for protection against disease. Female: There is also a female condom that lines the vagina, which is worn by the woman during sex for similar protection. Condoms are highly effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy if used consistently and correctly. Learn the right way to use a condom.
Condyloma Acuminatum—A projecting warty growth on the external genitals or the anus caused by infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is usually a benign or non-cancerous growth. Condyloma acuminatum is also referred to as genital warts or verruca acuminata.
Conization—Surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal. Conization may be used to diagnose or treat a cervical condition. Also called cone biopsy.
Contraception — Ways to prevent pregnancy. Some forms of contraception prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), fertilization (meeting of egg and sperm) or implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining. Birth control pills, condoms, and diaphrams are some examples of contraception.
Cross-dressing—Dressing in a manner more sterotpyically associated with the opposite sex. People who cross-dress generally have no intention or desire to change their anatomical sex, and cross-dressing does not necessarily reflect on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cryosurgery—Treatment performed with an instrument that freezes and destroys abnormal tissue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A herpes infection that causes serious illness in people with AIDS. CMV can develop in any part of the body but most often appears in the retina of the eye, the nervous system, the colon or the esophagus.
D
Dental dam—A sheet of latex that can be used to cover the vagina or anus during oral sex in order to prevent body fluids from passing from one person to another. It is called a dental dam because it was designed to be used for dental procedures. A substitute can be made by cutting off the tip and slitting the side of a latex condom.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
Dilation and curettage—A minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and tissue from the uterine lining can be scaped with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette. Also called a D and C.
Douching—Using water or a medicated solution to clean the vagina and cervix.
Dyspareunia—The medical term for painful sex.
Dysplasia—Abnormal changes or growth of cells and tissues. See Cervical dysplasia.

The quality of your sex life affects your entire life. So, if you’re having a hard time enjoying or desiring sex it’s important to find out why. There are a number of reasons for this, such as culture, background, and past sexual experiences. Emotional, physical, and psychological factors can affect intimacy and sex, too. These can include:
Relationship problems
Depression, anxiety, and stress
Age-related changes
Hormone changes
Certain medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis
Medication side effects (for instance, from medicines used to treat depression, anxiety, and blood pressure)
Troubles with having sex or enjoying it are sometimes called female sexual dysfunction or female sexual difficulties (FSD). It can be life-long or can develop over time. FSD is defined as persistent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm, or pain that causes you distress or strains your relationship with your partner. While every woman deserves a fulfilling sex life, more than 40% of women will have sexual difficulties at some point in their lives.
There are four main types of FSD:
Low sexual desire. Lack of interest in sex and sexual activity.
Sexual arousal disorder. Difficulty in becoming aroused or lack of sexual response during sexual activity.
Orgasmic disorder. Consistent difficulty (or inability) to reach orgasm.
Sexual pain disorder. Pain during intercourse (called dyspareunia) or with vaginal stimulation.
Many women experience one or more of these problems at one point or another, from trouble reaching orgasm or just not feeling “in the mood.” But for some women, these problems are ongoing and can affect a woman’s sense of well being and relationships.
The good news is that these problems can be treated. While there’s no magic bullet promising a quick and easy cure, there are ways to deal with sexual difficulties. The first step is to look at the possible causes.
Causes
Physical/biological: There are a number of physicial conditions that can affect a woman’s sexual response and reduce pleasure and satisfaction. For example, conditions such as thyroid disease and diabetes can result in reduced vaginal lubrication which can make sex uncomfortable and less satisfying. Hormonal issues, such low estrogen levels, can also reduce lubrication and thin the vaginal lining, while lowered testosterone levels can lower the sex drive.
A decreased sex drive can also be the result of certain medications, including drugs to control blood pressure and some antidepressants, and can make it difficult for a woman to reach orgasm. Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or vaginitis can all make sex uncomfortable or even painful, as can vaginal infections, pelvic surgery or bowel difficulties.
Psychological/emotional: A woman’s sexual response involves not just the body but the mind, of course, and emotional factors play a role in sexual satisfaction. Anxiety, depression, and simply the stresses of everyday life can contribute to sexual problems, as can problems in a relationship. Issues with body image as well as religious and/or cultural factors can also contribute.
Listen to ASHA’s three-part conversation with sociologist and sexual health expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz on female sexual difficulties. She discusses the range of female sexual difficulties, the impact of sexual difficulties on a relationship, and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You can listen on ASHA’s website or via iTunes.
Sometimes the issues that lead to sexual problems are temporary – such as stress or medication use – and can be resolved easily. But when does the occasional difficulty become a real problem? If difficulties are ongoing and causing distress, then it may be time to seek help.
Finding Help
A healthcare provider can help you figure out what might be behind the difficulties you’re experiencing and find ways to resolve the problem. Your provider will likely ask you about:
your medical history
any medications or supplements you may take
your sexual history
current and past relationships
Depending on your symptoms and concerns, she or he may do a pelvic exam to look for signs of infection or irritation or perhaps a pelvic ultrasound to identify any anatomical issues. If psychological issues seem to be the principle cause of the problem, your provider may offer a referral to a counselor.
If your problem has a hormonal cause, such as low estrogen or a thyroid deficiency, the provider may suggest a medical treatment option. She or he might also suggest adjusting or changing your current medication whose side effects may be causing your symptoms. But there are also non-medical options that can help.
Communication: Talk to your partner about your concerns and problems you are having and what your needs are. A caring partner will be willing to work with you to find solutions.
Experiment: Sometimes trying something new can help. For example, if pain is an issue, try new positions to discover what might be more comfortable. To address a lack of arousal or trouble reaching orgasm, you might spend more time on foreplay, explore sensual massage, or experiment with vibrators or other sex toys to see what you find pleasurable. The Sinclair Institute is one resource that offers sexual health products for adults.
Lubrication: Vaginal dryness can make sex uncomfortable, even painful. While this can be a result of different problem and medications, is it also a common problem among post-menopausal women. Using lubricants can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable. For some women, local hormonal therapy, such as an estrogen cream, might be recommended by a provider.
Talk with a professional: A counselor or therapist who specializes in sexuality and sexual problems can help both you and your partner better understand your sexual problems and offer and strategies to improve intimacy. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) allows you to search for a sex therapist or counselor in your area.

Menopause is a normal, natural event—not a disease.
Technically, you don’t actually “hit” menopause until it’s been one year since your final menstrual period. In the United States, that happens about age 51, on average. As women move beyond their childbearing years they may experience many physical and emotional changes.
Despite negative stereotypes, as well as some actual difficulties women can face during this time, many women report that once they’ve reached menopause they feel more confidant, stronger, and energized than they did before. At this period in their lives, many women have fewer child-rearing responsibilities and can use this time to take care of themselves. Women no longer have to worry about getting pregnant when having sex, potentially allowing for less stress and more enjoyment during sex.
Menopause isn’t a one-size-fits-all event, though. It affects each woman differently. Some women reach natural menopause with little to no trouble; others may experience symptoms that can hamper their lives. And when menopause starts suddenly as a result of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, the adjustment can be tough. Fortunately, menopause is better understood and more openly discussed than ever before. And better treatment options are available when needed.
Painful Sex? Getting Your Groove Back During Menopause
ASHA, in partnership with WebMD Education, has created a program to help women learn more about taking charge of their sexual health during menopause. In this program, you and your partner can learn about changes during menopause that may lead to vaginal dryness and painful sex; ways to get relief with over-the-counter or prescription medicines; and how to talk with your doctor about your concerns. You’ll also hear from a patient who shares her story.
Why Menopause Happens
A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and ovulation. Menopause occurs when the ovaries no longer produce an egg every month and menstruation stops.
Menopause, when it occurs after the age of 40, is considered “natural” and is a normal part of aging. But some women can experience menopause early, either as a result of a surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.
Natural menopause happens gradually. The ovaries don’t abruptly stop; they slow down. The transition to menopause is called perimenopause. During perimenopause, it’s still possible to get pregnant—a woman’s childbearing years are winding down, and although her periods may become more unpredictable, her ovaries are still functioning and she still may ovulate, though not necessarily on a monthly basis.
What to Expect
Here are some potential benefits of menopause:
Less stress about getting pregnant
More time for intimacy with a partner
Chance to reflect on priorities in life
Increased sexual pleasure and closeness with partner
While many women take advantage of this time of transition to make positive changes in their lives, some symptoms can be inconvenient or difficult to deal with. The signs and symptoms of menopause, which can vary in intensity from woman to woman, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. Symptoms may include:
Irregular periods
Decreased fertility
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Sleep disturbances
Mood swings
Increased abdominal fat
Thinning hair
Loss of breast fullness
When to See a Healthcare Provider
It’s important to see your healthcare provider during the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause) and the years after menopause for preventive health care as well as care of medical conditions that may occur with aging. If you’ve skipped a period but aren’t sure you’ve started menopause, you may want to see your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re pregnant. He or she may take a medical history, do a pelvic examination and, if appropriate, order a pregnancy test.
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause.
Alternative Medicine
Many approaches have been promoted as aids in managing the symptoms of menopause, but there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claims. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before taking any herbal treatments or dietary supplements for signs and symptoms of menopause. Herbal products can interfere or interact with other medications you may be taking.
Sexual Health after Menopause
What are some concerns about sexual health after menopause? For one, less estrogen can lead to vaginal dryness, which may make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. Try using a water-soluble lubricant during sex, or applying a vaginal moisturizer every few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin.
Libido may also change, for better or worse, but many factors besides menopause—including stress, medications, depression, poor sleep, and relationship problems—affect sex drive. Talk to your healthcare provider if sex problems occur—don’t settle for a so-so sex life. And remember, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) don’t end with menopause; safer sex still counts.
FAQs about Menopause
Does menopause lower sex drive in all women?No. In fact, some postmenopausal women report an increase in sex drive. This may be due to decreased anxiety associated with a fear of pregnancy. In addition, many postmenopausal women often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners. However, if you’re having concerns, take a look at this video for some reassurance and information about sexual difficulties women may face.
How does menopause affect sex drive?The loss of estrogen following menopause can lead to changes in a woman’s sexual drive and functioning. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women may notice that they are not as easily aroused, and may be less sensitive to touching and stroking—which can result in decreased interest in sex. Women who have a very low sex drive may be diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Until recently, there weren’t medical treatments available for women’s low sexual desire. However, an FDA advisory committee recently approved the drug Addyi to treat HSDD. Addyi is the first medication on the market to treat HSDD in women.
In addition, lower levels of estrogen can cause a decrease in blood supply to the vagina. This decreased blood flow can affect vaginal lubrication, causing the vagina to be too dry for comfortable intercourse. If you are not getting relief from lubricants and vaginal moisturizes, you might ask your healthcare provider about low dose vaginal estrogen. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal table
How can I treat vaginal dryness?Vaginal dryness can be treated with water-soluble lubricants such as Astroglide® or K-Y Jelly®. Do not use non-water soluble lubricants such as Vaseline® because they can weaken latex (the material used to make condoms, which should continue to be used to avoid pregnancy until your healthcare provider verifies you are not producing eggs and to prevent contracting STIs).
Vaginal moisturizers are another option for treating vaginal dryness. Vaginal moisturizers are applied regularly, not just before sex, and get absorbed into the skin. They can last for up to three to four days before needing to be re-applied.
In cases where lubricants and vaginal moisturizers are not helpful, low dose vaginal estrogen is another option. This is a form of estrogen therapy that is available by prescription in the form of vaginal creams, a vaginal ring, and a vaginal tablet. This type of therapy restores the health of and sexual functioning of vaginal tissue.
Can I get help?Although sexual problems can be difficult to discuss, talk to your healthcare provider; there are options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy, topical moisturizers or creams, potential new drugs coming on the market, or counseling. Your provider may refer you and your partner to a health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Sexual concerns may have a mental health component, and so the therapist may advise sexual counseling on an individual basis, with your partner or in a support group. This type of counseling can be very successful, even when it is done on a short-term basis.
Do I still have to worry about STIs?Absolutely! Just as you must use protection if you do not want to become pregnant, you must also take measures to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It’s important to remember that your risk of contracting STIs is a possibility at any point in your life during which you are sexually active, and this risk does not go down with age.
How can I protect myself against STIs?Here are some basic steps that you can take to help protect yourself from STIs:
Use a latex condom consistently and correctly every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant when using condoms, make sure it is water-based (not oil-based, like Vaseline®.)
Make sure to wash sex toys before sharing with a partner, or use a condom and switch condoms before sharing.
Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get an STD/STI.
Practice mutual monogamy. This means having sex with only one person who only has sex with you.
Choose your sex partners with care. Make sure both of you have been tested for STDs/STIs (before having sex).
Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high.
Learn about STDs/STIs. The more you know about STDs/STIs, the better you can protect yourself.

The quality of your sex life affects your entire life. So, if you’re having a hard time enjoying or desiring sex it’s important to find out why. There are a number of reasons for this, such as culture, background, and past sexual experiences. Emotional, physical, and psychological factors can affect intimacy and sex, too. These can include:
Relationship problems
Depression, anxiety, and stress
Age-related changes
Hormone changes
Certain medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis
Medication side effects (for instance, from medicines used to treat depression, anxiety, and blood pressure)
Troubles with having sex or enjoying it are sometimes called female sexual dysfunction or female sexual difficulties (FSD). It can be life-long or can develop over time. FSD is defined as persistent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm, or pain that causes you distress or strains your relationship with your partner. While every woman deserves a fulfilling sex life, more than 40% of women will have sexual difficulties at some point in their lives.
There are four main types of FSD:
Low sexual desire. Lack of interest in sex and sexual activity.
Sexual arousal disorder. Difficulty in becoming aroused or lack of sexual response during sexual activity.
Orgasmic disorder. Consistent difficulty (or inability) to reach orgasm.
Sexual pain disorder. Pain during intercourse (called dyspareunia) or with vaginal stimulation.
Many women experience one or more of these problems at one point or another, from trouble reaching orgasm or just not feeling “in the mood.” But for some women, these problems are ongoing and can affect a woman’s sense of well being and relationships.
The good news is that these problems can be treated. While there’s no magic bullet promising a quick and easy cure, there are ways to deal with sexual difficulties. The first step is to look at the possible causes.
Causes
Physical/biological: There are a number of physicial conditions that can affect a woman’s sexual response and reduce pleasure and satisfaction. For example, conditions such as thyroid disease and diabetes can result in reduced vaginal lubrication which can make sex uncomfortable and less satisfying. Hormonal issues, such low estrogen levels, can also reduce lubrication and thin the vaginal lining, while lowered testosterone levels can lower the sex drive.
A decreased sex drive can also be the result of certain medications, including drugs to control blood pressure and some antidepressants, and can make it difficult for a woman to reach orgasm. Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or vaginitis can all make sex uncomfortable or even painful, as can vaginal infections, pelvic surgery or bowel difficulties.
Psychological/emotional: A woman’s sexual response involves not just the body but the mind, of course, and emotional factors play a role in sexual satisfaction. Anxiety, depression, and simply the stresses of everyday life can contribute to sexual problems, as can problems in a relationship. Issues with body image as well as religious and/or cultural factors can also contribute.
Listen to ASHA’s three-part conversation with sociologist and sexual health expert Dr. Pepper Schwartz on female sexual difficulties. She discusses the range of female sexual difficulties, the impact of sexual difficulties on a relationship, and offers practical advice and resources for women (and their partners). You can listen on ASHA’s website or via iTunes.
Sometimes the issues that lead to sexual problems are temporary – such as stress or medication use – and can be resolved easily. But when does the occasional difficulty become a real problem? If difficulties are ongoing and causing distress, then it may be time to seek help.
Finding Help
A healthcare provider can help you figure out what might be behind the difficulties you’re experiencing and find ways to resolve the problem. Your provider will likely ask you about:
your medical history
any medications or supplements you may take
your sexual history
current and past relationships
Depending on your symptoms and concerns, she or he may do a pelvic exam to look for signs of infection or irritation or perhaps a pelvic ultrasound to identify any anatomical issues. If psychological issues seem to be the principle cause of the problem, your provider may offer a referral to a counselor.
If your problem has a hormonal cause, such as low estrogen or a thyroid deficiency, the provider may suggest a medical treatment option. She or he might also suggest adjusting or changing your current medication whose side effects may be causing your symptoms. But there are also non-medical options that can help.
Communication: Talk to your partner about your concerns and problems you are having and what your needs are. A caring partner will be willing to work with you to find solutions.
Experiment: Sometimes trying something new can help. For example, if pain is an issue, try new positions to discover what might be more comfortable. To address a lack of arousal or trouble reaching orgasm, you might spend more time on foreplay, explore sensual massage, or experiment with vibrators or other sex toys to see what you find pleasurable. The Sinclair Institute is one resource that offers sexual health products for adults.
Lubrication: Vaginal dryness can make sex uncomfortable, even painful. While this can be a result of different problem and medications, is it also a common problem among post-menopausal women. Using lubricants can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable. For some women, local hormonal therapy, such as an estrogen cream, might be recommended by a provider.
Talk with a professional: A counselor or therapist who specializes in sexuality and sexual problems can help both you and your partner better understand your sexual problems and offer and strategies to improve intimacy. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) allows you to search for a sex therapist or counselor in your area.
