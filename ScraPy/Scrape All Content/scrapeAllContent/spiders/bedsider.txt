Customized Reminders
One of the favorite features on Bedsider is our free reminders. Users can download an app and schedule birth control reminders for the pill, patch, ring, or shot. We even have discreet reminders for those concerned about confidentiality. Users can also schedule text and email appointment reminders so they don’t forget their next office visit.
Health Center Finder
Bedsider has the most comprehensive list of where to get birth control ever compiled. If you’d like to provide people with access to our directory, it is available to embed on your website or blog. Just send us a note at providers@bedsider.org and we'll get you set up.
By the way, we welcome you to add your clinic, practice, or location if it’s not already in our directory. Try searching for your site using the health center search on Bedsider's Where to Get It page. If you don't show up in the results, click the link below the map on that page and send us your information. It's that easy!
Method photos
Bedsider offers licensing solutions for our library of professional birth control images for use on websites or in your own patient materials. Please visit Power to Decide's Select360 Consulting page to learn more about licensing photography.
API feed of information
Bedsider offers detailed information on every birth control method available in the U.S. (And along with our medical advisors and partners, we’ve gone to great lengths to make sure it’s 100% accurate and unboring.)
By using the application program interface (a.k.a. "API"), Providers can access all of the information from our method detail pages, feature articles, and questions, and use it on a website. That way, when we update our content, the content in the API gets automatically updated too.
Please visit Power to Decide's Select360 Consulting page to learn more about licensing content from Bedsider.

By talking about physical, mental, and social well-being in relationships and sexual development in the exam room, we model a safe way to have these discussions that can be continued at home.
Setting the Stage for Conversation
Families often want to have sexual and reproductive conversations with their young people, but sometimes don’t know where to begin. As a provider, you can reassure family members that they do not have to have one big “talk” about sexual and reproductive health, as this can be overwhelming for everyone involved. Instead, recommend that they start with smaller, more frequent conversations from an early age to make it easier for kids and teens to take in new information.
At the start of each health visit, introduce yourself and your role, and ask each person present to introduce themselves and their relationship to each other. During the visit, you should use anatomically correct terms when describing the human body to people of all ages. This sets the stage to encourage families to do the same.
Listen Before Talking
Young people love asking questions, and by listening carefully, families and providers can look for themes in the questions that lay the groundwork for deeper conversations. Listening also shows young people that their questions and concerns are valid and important. If the family is unsure of the answer to a question or uncomfortable with the question being asked, assure them that they are always welcome to call your office or schedule a visit to talk. As providers, we may not always know the answer to every question, but we can help families by researching the answers with them. Collaborating directly with families to uncover answers empowers everyone involved.
It’s important for health care providers to recognize that the cultural and religious norms of families vary and affect how families talk about sex and relationships. If you’re unsure of a family’s views around sexual and reproductive health, ask them! They likely have questions, concerns, and wisdom to share that will enrich discussions.
Confidentiality
State laws vary in what services, including sexual and reproductive health care, substance abuse, and mental health services, people under age 18 can receive from their health care providers without the knowledge of a legal guardian. As a health care provider, take the time to review your state’s laws and share that information with young people and their families so they all know what services minors can access without their guardian’s consent.
You can also share with families that young people are more likely to be open about their sexual and reproductive questions and experiences if they trust that their conversations will be kept in confidence. For example, frame conversations by saying, “the things you tell me in private will be kept private. If there is something going on, and I am concerned about your safety, we can’t keep that a secret. If that happens, we will go together to get you the help you need.”
Understanding Consent
Families and providers can begin discussing consent as soon as kids can communicate. For younger children, caregivers can model consent by asking permission before giving physical affection and teaching children to do the same with others. As they become older, examples from the media can serve as relevant conversation starters for discussions about why it’s important to get affirmative consent before any physical touching, every time. Families and providers can review Bedsider content for ideas and questions to start conversations about enthusiastic consent, sexual assault, and more.
Families and health care providers should also encourage young people to trust their gut feelings and speak out if they are uncomfortable with how someone is treating them or touching them. You can ask young people to think about who they can talk about their relationships without fear of judgment and to consider that it may not be someone in their family. Young people may not feel comfortable, or safe, talking to family members about sex, love, and relationships. You can ask more about their experiences and listen to them without recommending or requiring that they talk to family members. Providers and families can also share resources, like RAINN’s confidential 24/7 online chat and hotline services, if young people have questions or want to know more about relationships and consent.
Health care providers should use the principles of explicit consent during every physical exam, beginning with the first well-child check.
Bottom Line
Health care providers are in a position to empower families to have thoughtful and intentional conversations about sexual and reproductive health. Conversations should start early and occur frequently. Begin by engaging families about their beliefs and values around sexual and reproductive health and encouraging them to listen to their young people without judgement. Both families and providers play an important role in discussing sexual and reproductive health including teaching about consent and respecting confidentiality.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisWhy (and how) providers should get consent in the exam roomUsing the principles of explicit consent to give patients better careby Jennifer Keller, MD MPHpublished 03/22/19From the #metoo movement to reports of sexual assault being front and center on national television with the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, consent has been making the news headlines. Health care providers have an opportunity to provide a safe space to discuss enthusiastic consent in relationships and to model it in the exam room by obtaining explicit consent from our patients prior to performing intimate exams in the office. Consent is an important component of establishing a respectful and trusting relationship with your patient—one that improves satisfaction, adherence, and ultimately, outcomes.
Obtaining consent for an exam does not need to mean having a patient sign a lengthy consent form before a pelvic exam is performed. It does involve asking and waiting for verbal permission to touch. Here are a few practical examples of how you can incorporate the language of explicit consent in the exam room:
1. Greet your patients when they’re fully clothed
Sending the message that you care about consent and welcome patients as equal participants in their health care starts before you walk through the door. When your staff asks a patient to undress before you even meet them, such that they’re in a gown, sitting on the exam table at your first meeting, you’re taking away their opportunity to consent to each step of that interaction with you. Equally problematic is the fact that you’re establishing an uneven power dynamic at your first meeting. You, the clothed person (who already holds more power in the relationship as the provider), have your dignity and personhood intact, while your patient is left feeling exposed and stripped of any markers of identity their clothes may hold for them. They’re reduced to being just a body.
2. Ask before you touch instead of tell before you touch
Small changes to the way you communicate can let patients know they have choices and are in control of what happens to their body. Asking for consent to proceed with an exam, offering the option to defer an exam to another visit, and clearly communicating that you can stop the exam at any time can go a long way towards building trust. Instead of telling the patient, “Now you are going to feel my touch,” you could ask, “Is it okay if I touch now?” This shift in language does not require any additional time but is much more patient-centered.
3. Check in during the exam
When performing a pelvic exam, ensuring that the head of the table is elevated about 30 degrees allows you to make eye contact with the patient and to get visual feedback about how the exam is going for them. Checking in during the exam by asking, “How are you doing?” or “Tell me whenever you are ready to proceed or if you want to stop,” will help them feel more comfortable asking you to stop.
For patients with a history of sexual abuse or trauma, studies have shown that the ability to maintain control over the exam is essential to making them feel respected and valued by their health care provider.
Preface your exam with a statement such as, “I will stop anytime you ask me to,” and then uphold that promise. If a patient asks you to stop what you are doing, stop immediately, no matter how close you are to the end of the exam or procedure, and wait for permission to continue.
4. Offer a chaperone
Regardless of your gender, offering a chaperone during breast and pelvic exams can help patients feel more comfortable. However, be aware that while some people may feel more comfortable with a chaperone in the room, others may feel less comfortable having anyone in the room other than the provider—it’s the offering that’s key! Additionally, if you work with learners, like students or residents, it is essential that you ask for permission to have them present for or participate in the exam. Asking for permission BEFORE the learner or chaperone comes into the room gives the patient permission to decline without having to say it in front of that person.
5. Stop if your patient says “no”
If your patient says “no” to an exam, it is essential to respect their decision. That means you don’t proceed with an exam until you have consent, and you don’t pressure your patients into giving consent. Carefully consider how much information you will be getting from your exam, and, if it is reasonable, create a plan of care without it. Pressuring patients into giving consent or proceeding without it isn’t just counterproductive to establishing trust, it’s a violation.
A good next step is exploring the patient’s concerns by actively listening and using open-ended questions. Perhaps they are worried about a prior negative experience or maybe they are simply worried about how much something will cost.
6. Consent applies to birth control too
Respect your patient’s decisions about their contraceptive choices. What matters most is not what you think is the “best” choice for them but what they think is best for them. (If that strikes a nerve for you, you may want to spend some time thinking about why you’re having trouble respecting this particular patient’s decisions. You may want to look into implicit bias.) Realize and respect that the factor patients feel is most important in their method may not be its effectiveness, and that pregnancy desires vary widely (and include ambivalence).
Respecting patient autonomy is particularly important with methods that have to be removed by a provider, like IUDs and the implant.
Providers should remind patients that they can choose to have these methods removed at any point for any reason (or no reason at all!).
And if a patient wants a method removed, it is your obligation to remove it without any unnecessary delay.
7. Always get consent for an exam under anesthesia
Obtaining explicit consent for any pelvic exam while under anesthesia is crucial to ethical care. It is essential to discuss the reason for performing a pelvic exam while under anesthesia, who will be present, and who will be participating in the exams and procedures.
If you have a learner who will be performing an exam it is essential that they meet the patient before induction of anesthesia and that you have explicit consent for your student to perform an exam.
Respecting our patients by prioritizing communication and explicit consent in the exam room strengthens the patient-provider relationship and ultimately improves health. (It’s also the right thing to do!) When we respect our patients and their choices by advocating for consent and encouraging participation in exams and care plans, we are reinforcing that they have the right to speak up and to be heard. And when patients feel heard and respected, they are more likely to come to us when they need our help instead of avoiding getting care.

We’ve searched the journals and read the practice updates to round up this month’s top research and guidelines on birth control, sexual health, abortion, STIs, and more! This new feature will be posted at the end of each month.
1. Medication Abortion Provided Through Telemedicine in Four U.S. States
2. TelAbortion: evaluation of a direct to patient telemedicine abortion service in the United States
As access to abortion services varies widely across the county, national telemedicine medication abortion has the potential to fill in the gaps. The first of these two studies, expands upon the
well-documented, recognized safety of telemedicine when used for medication abortion. In this retrospective cohort study, published in Obstetrics & Gynecology in August 2019, almost 6,000 medication abortions were reviewed in four states (Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington), comparing telemedicine to in-person medication abortions. For patients who followed up after their medication abortion, adverse events were extremely rare in both groups, and ongoing pregnancy was not more common with telemedicine medication abortions. This study adds to what we already know about medication abortion provided through telemedicine: it is safe and acceptable and should be available particularly in areas with limited access to health care resources and/or few abortion providers.
Support for the use of telemedicine abortion services is further highlighted by a study published in Contraception in September 2019. In this innovative study, researchers in five states (Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Maine, and New York) expanded abortion care using a service they termed “TelAbortion.” With this service, patients received mifepristone and misoprostol by mail after having a virtual visit with a provider. Similar to an in-person visit, 93% of patients had a complete abortion without needing a procedure. Medication abortion with mifepristone by mail, is not currently FDA approved outside of a research study. These studies provide further support for the efficacy and safety of telemedicine solutions to extend FDA approval and expand access to abortion services nationwide.
3. Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate, Oral Contraceptive, Intrauterine Device Use, and Fracture Risk
The FDA previously issued a black-box warning regarding use of the shot, also known as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA, for more than two years due to possible adverse effects on bone health and subsequent fracture risk. Researchers at Kaiser Permanente aimed to evaluate fracture risk associated with the use of the shot as compared to the pill and IUDs with a retrospective cohort study. They found a lower fracture risk in users of the pill than people who used the shot for two cumulative years or more. The researchers also found a slightly increased fracture risk in patients who used the shot, however absolute fracture risk was low. When it comes to talking about these findings with patients, providers should weigh this small fracture risk against risks associated with unwanted pregnancy or other non-contraceptive benefits of using the shot.
4. Intrauterine Device Use and Ovarian Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Using either the levonorgestrel hormonal IUD or the non-hormonal, copper IUD was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer in this meta-analysis published in Obstetrics & Gynecology. The authors pooled data from 11 large case-control and cohort studies and found a 32% decrease chance of ovarian cancer for those who use any type of IUD. Other methods of birth control, like the pill, the patch, and the ring have also been shown to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer. While prospective data about the use of IUDs and future development of ovarian cancer is still needed, providers can now share this new evidence about decreased ovarian cancer risk when counseling patients considering an IUD for any reason.
5. Copper intrauterine device placement 6–14 days after unprotected sex
A significant percentage of people seeking a copper, non-hormonal IUD for emergency contraception have had unprotected intercourse both within five days as well as within the 6 -14 days prior to presentation, and providers may be reluctant to insert an IUD in these patients for concern of disrupting an early pregnancy. This study pooled several smaller protocols to identify 134 people who had a copper IUD placed after unprotected intercourse 6 -14 days before placement, with a negative urine pregnancy test in clinic; they found that zero patients reported a pregnancy in the four weeks after placement. While a smaller study, this data may encourage providers to continue providing same-day copper IUD placement for all patients with negative pregnancy tests, rather than asking them to return for placement after their next period.
6. Contraceptive Eligibility for Women at High Risk of HIV (WHO)
The World Health Organization has updated its guidance statement on contraception options for HIV negative women who are at high-risk of HIV. In a review of the current data, they conclude that women at high-risk of HIV are eligible for all methods of contraception without restriction, including combined hormonal contraception (like the pill, the patch, and the ring), progesterone-only contraception (like the mini-pill and the shot), implants, and IUDs. They note that those who are at high-risk of HIV may also be at high-risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and recommend following appropriate STI screening protocols before IUD insertion in these patients. Additionally, providers should review strategies for decreasing the risks of HIV transmission, such as using barrier methods, like condoms and internal condoms, as well as reviewing and recommending pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) for those who are at high risk of HIV. Providers can rely on this guidance statement to support offering all forms of contraception to patients at high-risk for HIV infection.
7. Hormonal Contraceptives and the Acquisition of Sexually Transmitted Infections
Evidence published in 2008 suggested that hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of non-HIV STIs, possibly by disrupting immune modulation or the vaginal epithelial barrier, or by leading to behavioral changes (i.e., decreased condom use). In this publication, researchers performed a systematic review of studies published between 2009-2017 that focused on hormonal contraceptives and non-HIV STI transmission. They found that there was a decreased risk of trichomonas acquisition with the shot and the pill, and a possible increased risk of HSV-2, one of the viruses that causes herpes, with the shot. Researchers found inconclusive evidence about the acquisition of HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, so further research is needed to clarify these findings and expand data to include all types of hormonal contraceptives.
Providers should prescribe contraception according to patient preference and should counsel that hormonal contraceptives do not protect against STIs. Providers should also review that barrier methods like condoms, internal condoms, and dental dams can decrease the risk of STIs.
8. Prevalence of Oral HPV Infection in Unvaccinated Men and Women in the United States, 2009-2016
Since the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine became a standard recommendation for females in 2006, its ability to create herd immunity against oral HPV infection has not been well-studied. Although oral HPV infection is not technically a vaccine indication, researchers from the National Cancer Institute suspected that widespread vaccination against HPV contributes to improved herd immunity. Using a survey-based study, a large cross-sectional sample of US residents were examined, with results reflecting more than 170 million individuals. Vaccine-type oral HPV infections declined by 37% in a sample of unvaccinated men, suggesting that vaccination of females is leading to herd immunity. These findings further support HPV vaccination for everyone.
9. Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2017
In reviewing abortion data across the United States from 2014 to 2017 in their Abortion Provider Census, the Guttmacher Institute found that the number of abortions performed continued to decline, decreasing 7% from 2014 to 2017, to the lowest recorded total since the legalization of abortion in 1973. In 2017, 18% of all pregnancies ended in abortion, and approximately one third (39%) of abortion in 2017 were medication abortions, a 25% increase from 2014. The number of health institutions providing abortions decreased slightly during this time but was more pronounced in the South and Midwest. While the number of legislative restrictions on abortion increased during this time, the authors concluded that the continued decrease in abortion is more likely to be caused by improved contraceptive use and associated decreased fertility rates, as well as increases in self-managed abortion.

But what if I told you that our rapport—and the quality of the care we provide overall—actually affects our patients’ long-term birth control use?
A new study that we did shows exactly that. Patients who reported high “interpersonal quality of family planning care”—meaning they felt respected and heard while talking about birth control with their provider—were more likely to keep using their chosen birth control method six months later.
Measuring patients’ experiences with their providers
So how did we measure whether a patient felt respected and heard while talking about birth control with a provider? We recognize that this is no easy task: there are so many unique ways a patient might feel about her or his visit. We needed to find a way to capture the many layers of unique interactions between patients and health care providers.
Using previous work on women’s preferences for contraceptive counseling, we created the interpersonal quality in family planning (IQFP) scale. The scale let patients rate their experiences from 0 meaning “poor” to 5 meaning “excellent,” and asked questions like whether the provider:
Respected them as a person,
Took their preferences about birth control seriously,
Considered their personal situation when advising about birth control, and
Answered all their questions.
In addition to asking each client these questions, we got their permission to audio record their visits. We listened to the visits afterwards and evaluated how well the provider engaged in patient-centered communication described by the Four Habits framework. We used the same 5-point scale of poor to excellent to give providers at each visit a rating on the habits related to birth control shown in the box.
Respect + listening + warmth = contraceptive continuation
We got back in touch with patients about six months after their visit and asked them about their birth control. Patients who reported that their provider respected them, took their preferences seriously, gave them personalized information, and answered all their questions were more likely to be using their chosen birth control method 6 months later, even after taking into account other factors that might influence this.
Two of the four habits were also important for birth control continuation. Patients whose providers used Habits 1 and 2 (investing in the beginning and eliciting the patient perspective) were more likely to use their chosen method continuously. We wouldn’t say that the other two habits aren’t important, but they weren’t as strongly related to birth control continuation.
How can providers use this information?
There are lots of ethical arguments for why we as providers should offer high-quality counseling to the people we serve. This study provides concrete evidence that the quality of birth control counseling matters for our patients’ outcomes. Continuing to use a method of birth control suggests that these patients had found a method that was working for them, which can be a long journey.
Respectful, personalized, and patient-centered birth control counseling sets a foundation for our patients to find the method that works best for them. If you want to try this in your own practice, pay attention to how well you engage in each of the Four Habits during your clinical encounters.
When our patients trust us as providers and view counseling experiences positively, they may be more likely to return to us for care—for birth control or any other highly personal issue. In the end, having a respectful relationship and paying careful attention to the dynamics between you and your patient has bigger implications than just being a “gold standard” for care. It has the potential to empower your patients to achieve their reproductive health and life goals—outcomes about which both patients and providers can be happy.
Christine Dehlendorf, MD, MAS, is the Director of the Program in Woman-Centered Contraception at the University of California, San Francisco. As a family doctor, she is passionate about taking care of women in all stages of life, and about honoring and trusting women in their reproductive decisions. That said, she is still wondering why no one gave her a how-to manual when they sent her home from the hospital with her first child.
Alexis Hoffman is a research assistant at the Program in Woman-Centered Contraception. Thanks to extremely lackluster counseling when she was a teenager, the only birth control method she knew existed was the pill! She is passionate about every patient knowing the full scope of methods available to them, increasing accessibility to compassionate care, and decreasing stigma associated with exerting reproductive choices. She’s also an NPR and podcast lover.

Not a provider? VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisYour patient has the answerby Alissa Perrucci, PhD, MPHpublished 02/25/19Recently in clinic we worked with a patient who really struggled with their pregnancy decision.
They’d come in twice for counseling, during the last visit had decided to have an abortion, and had laminaria placed.
On the day of the operative visit, however, they were considering having their laminaria removed to continue the pregnancy.
Patient struggles such as these usually are stressful for staff, even in the best scenarios.
We worry that we didn’t do a skilled enough job working with her ambivalence, we contemplate concepts such as competence, and we worry about doing no harm.
We have been known to miss the forest for the trees—to miss the fact that our patient is a person, making their own decision.
That they have agency, even in the context of low freedom.
And that all along they have been making decisions, even if those decisions seem contradictory or do not progress simply and cleanly from our perspective.
I have found that one of the most rewarding components of nurturing and developing members of the clinic team is talking about how to prevent and manage the stress and burnout that comes from the temptation to take ownership of and responsibility for other people’s behavior.
This is a lifelong practice for me personally.
Working in direct care is difficult; we have to have a way to be empathetic and compassionate while maintaining our sanity, at a minimum, and ideally maintaining our gratitude and passion as well.
Essential to maintaining this perspective is an acknowledgment of the personhood of the other; their right and their ability to make their own health care decisions.
Believe in your patient
You are the health care professional, and you bring to the table expertise and knowledge in nursing, medicine, and counseling.
Your patient is the expert on their life and needs.
Believing in your patient means you are freeing them and freeing yourself.
Living this principle allows us to be authentically present to our patients, to actively and deeply listen, and to remain curious, open, and interested in them.
When we trust that the patient has the answer to their dilemma, we understand that their decisions may differ from what we would decide for ourselves.
To work toward living this principle we free ourselves from the notion that we possess knowledge about the rightness of another person’s decision that they themselves do not possess.
We free ourselves from the notion that we can control events and outcomes.
Our liberation is grounded in the belief that women are people—that they are subjects in the world, and that they are capable of making their own decisions.
There are three behaviors that prepare us to believe in our patients and stay fully engaged in and energized by our work.
I think of these as the “state of mind” in which we approach our work.
The behaviors are: listening, not assuming, and self-reflecting.
1. True listening first involves a commitment to stop talking
We can only listen when we create a space for the patient to speak.
Listening can be augmented through open-ended questions.
During a period of listening, consider opting for one open-ended question in lieu of a series of closed-ended questions.
For example, after imparting test results or answering a challenging question about D&E, consider a period of silence followed by an open-ended question such as, “How is it for you, hearing that?” You can tailor the question to suit your style, but the point is its open-endedness.
We are often tempted to fill the space between ourselves and our patients with the sound of our own voice. The more uncomfortable or uncertain we are, the more compelled we are to fill it. With experience, we realize that we are strong enough to hold that space. So, the next time you’re concerned that you don’t have something clever to say, create a space of silence instead. You are giving your patient permission to express themselves and reminding yourself to access your own competence and confidence.
2. Not assuming means that we step out of ‘professional mode’
In ‘professional mode,’ we are supposed to have the answers.
When we are not assuming, we allow ourselves to learn from the patient.
Learning from the patient comes from asking questions that seek to understand their personal experience.
It involves letting go of assumptions around a shared understanding of feelings or the meaning of different life events.
Lead with your desire to learn. When your patient in the abortion clinic says that they saw pictures on the Internet of fetal development, ask—with a genuine curiosity and openness—what that was like for them.
Allow yourself to be surprised by the answer and willing to validate that meaning for them.
3. Self-reflecting is last, but not least
The practice of self-reflecting on our values surrounding contraceptive care, pregnancy decisions, and all kinds of patient choices begins with answering the following questions:
a) “What scenarios in my work do I find difficult?”
b) “Which contraceptive/pregnancy/other decisions do I find myself wanting patients to make?”
c) “What decisions do I think are foolish?”
This exercise brings into conscious awareness our preferences, biases, and judgments about the behavior of others—which is part of being human.
Taking it to the next level, we can reflect on how these preferences are connected to expectations that we have about our own behavior and our tolerance for our own imperfections. With experience, we know that while we care about others, we are not the same person, and if faced with a similar situation might make a totally different decision. Our liberation comes from acknowledging this connection, yet believing in the rights of others to make their own way.
Trying this in your practice
Growing and improving in any skilled activity requires two things: practice and feedback. Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson coined the term deliberate practice to illustrate the qualities and behaviors of people who achieve mastery in their particular domain of interest.
It’s not just about putting in the hours, but also having a way to evaluate one’s performance through feedback.
That can be scary, but if you have access to it, consider having a colleague observe some of your patient interactions.
Another approach is to pay closer attention to how patients respond to you.
How much personal information do they share?
Do they ask difficult questions?
When you respond to a difficult question, what shifts do you notice in their countenance, the tone of their voice, or their language?
You have in front of you the opportunity to gather data on the impact of your style and content.
Use it to inform and adjust your approach.
Allow yourself to be inspired to build your skills and increase your happiness.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisPulling out all the stops: Doubling up with withdrawalThe oldest method of birth control is still going strong—and it plays well with others. by Jenny Higgins, PhD, MPHpublished 08/19/15Withdrawal, or pulling out, is often ignored by health care providers and researchers as a form of birth control. The U.S.’s top public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), doesn’t even include withdrawal on its list of contraceptive methods.
When researchers ask people about the birth control they use, they sometimes don’t ask about withdrawal.
But the best studies we have suggest the majority of people in the U.S. have used it at least once in their lives.
We also know that withdrawal has a long history. In fact, before modern birth control existed, it was a critical way for people all over the world to limit the size of their families. So what do we really know about who uses withdrawal and how? Let’s talk details.
How many people use withdrawal?
One recent article proclaimed that today’s 30-somethings are “the pull-out generation,”, but research suggests that very few couples in the U.S. use withdrawal as their only method of birth control. The proportion of people using this method alone has either remained steady or declined over the last 20 years. Today, only about 3% of U.S. women say they rely on withdrawal alone.
But that doesn’t tell you much about how people use it, or how they combine it with other methods.
Pulling out all the stops
Two recent studies showed that lots of people use withdrawal, and that they often use it in combination with another method of birth control.
In a large study of U.S. women, about 1 in 3 (33%) had used withdrawal at least once in the last month, but less half of them (14%) reported that withdrawal was the most effective form of birth control they used. Sounds like a big difference from the 3% who said they rely on withdrawal in the CDC survey, right? For this study, the researchers asked about withdrawal separately from other methods, which they think led more people to report it.
Many people don’t think of withdrawal as an official method of birth control, so they might not select it from a longer list of methods.
In a national study that asked young people about the last time they had penis-vagina sex, 14% of women and 17% of men reported using withdrawal. But only 7% and 6%, respectively, reported withdrawal as their only method. In this study, people chose their method(s) from a long list, so they might have reported using withdrawal less often than if they had been asked about it directly in a separate question.
In both studies, the methods people reported using along with withdrawal were most often the pill or condoms.
Some people said they used withdrawal along with an extremely effective method like the IUD.
The bottom line: most folks who use withdrawal are doubling it up, sometimes using it at the same time as another method and sometimes switching between withdrawal and another method.
Withdrawal-plus benefits
These studies both showed that some folks are using withdrawal to double or even triple-up on birth control—pulling out all the stops, as it were. Let’s call this idea “withdrawal-plus.”
And let’s take a moment to point out that withdrawal-plus busts the myth that people who use withdrawal are lazy or clueless.
Adding withdrawal to your birth control mix has some interesting potential benefits.
It may help both people in a couple play a role in pregnancy prevention—as in, “you take the pill, I’ll pull out.” For folks who feel that condoms reduce sexual pleasure—and who know they’re both in the clear on STIs—using withdrawal-plus may offer a more pleasurable alternative . It can also help guys get more in tune with their bodies, since withdrawal requires that you know when you’re about to ejaculate.
Withdrawal-only benefits
There are some cases when using withdrawal by itself may be a good option.
If a couple prefers to avoid pregnancy but doesn’t have any other birth control available, withdrawal can be their best friend—it’s free, can be used spontaneously any time, and is much more effective than using nothing.
For couples who’ve thought and talked about their desires and plans for family and agreed they’re open to the idea of a pregnancy, using withdrawal as their only method may be appealing.
That way, they can let a pregnancy happen rather than deliberately try to conceive. In fact, in both the studies I described above, people who were on the fence about pregnancy were more likely to have used withdrawal recently, either by itself or with another method.
So however you may choose to use withdrawal, enjoy!

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisCan premedication make IUD insertion less painful?Contrary to popular belief, ibuprofen does NOT work.by Lynn Ngo, MD, MPHpublished 05/26/16From a clinician’s perspective, inserting an intrauterine device (IUD) is a relatively quick procedure. However, during that short time, some patients may experience serious pain, notably when we pass the uterine sound and IUD inserter through the cervical os and up to the fundus. My patients are often worried about this pain and want to take something before their visit to make insertion more comfortable. Is there something we can recommend that actually works?
The appeal of premedication
Premedication has several advantages, especially if patients can take a medication orally prior to the appointment. Taking a medication in advance of the procedure allows it to take effect by the time the patient is in the exam room and prevents interruptions in clinic flow. In the context of IUD insertion, premedication would ideally help reduce the cramping that some patients experience after the procedure, allowing them to return to work, school or other responsibilities, and get themselves where they’re going next without a helper. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that several types of premedication are disappointing in terms of pain control.
Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used for post-procedural pain control. It is often recommended prior to IUD insertion, but there are now 4 randomized controlled trials demonstrating that it doesn’t reduce pain during insertion. These trials studied dosages varying from 400-800 mg. So it’s clear that ibuprofen should not be recommended as a premedication for reducing pain during IUD insertion. Unfortunately, most of these trials did not evaluate post-procedural pain control. The one trial that did found no reduction in pain, but they asked patients 4-6 hours after the procedure. By that point, any effect of the ibuprofen may have worn off. We’d need more research to know for sure whether ibuprofen should be recommended for post-procedural pain control.
What about other types of NSAIDs?
Naproxen sodium
Naproxen sodium (e.g. Aleve®), another type of NSAID, has been shown to reduce pain during IUD insertion in patients who have previously given birth. One study found a clinically meaningful reduction in pain scores with a dose of 550 mg of naproxen sodium taken 1 hour prior to IUD insertion. An older trial demonstrated that when patients took 300 mg of naproxen sodium before IUD insertion, they had reported less pain 1-2 hours after the procedure, but no change in pain during IUD insertion. Another trial is underway looking at the effectiveness of 550 mg in patients who have not given birth, and will measure pain levels both during and after IUD insertion.
Ketorolac
What if a patient is concerned about pain during IUD insertion but did not premedicate?
In this case, another type of NSAID given as an intramuscular gluteal injection may be an option: ketorolac. A recent trial gave ketorolac to patients at least 30 minutes prior to IUD insertion.
For women who had not given birth, there was a reduction in pain during IUD insertion.
For women who had given birth, ketorolac had no effect on pain during the insertion.
But all patients who received ketorolac reported lower pain scores starting at 5 minutes after the procedure when compared to a control group. One potential drawback of ketorolac is pain caused by the injection itself: about one-fifth of study participants felt the pain of the injection was just as bad as the IUD insertion.
Misoprostol
It’s not an NSAID, but misoprostol has also been tested as a premedication for IUD insertion.
Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue often used to help soften the cervix in pregnant women, which led researchers to wonder if it would help soften the cervix for IUD insertion and make the procedure less painful. Unfortunately, misoprostol does not reduce pain with IUD insertion—and for some women it may actually worsen pain. It can also cause greater pre-procedure cramping and other unpleasant side effects. The drawbacks of misoprostol clearly outweigh any potential benefits—we should not be using it as a premedication for IUD insertion with the intent of reducing pain.
Local anesthesia
Local anesthetics given at the time of the procedure may be another route for pain control, though their effectiveness varies depending on type and potency of anesthetic, route of administration, and amount administered. Moreover, it would not help with post-procedural cramping. For more information on this and other anesthetic options, check out the most recent Cochrane Review from 2015 on interventions for pain with IUD insertion.
The takeaway
At the present time, oral naproxen sodium seems to be the best option for our patients who want to take something prior to their visit, though more data will be available in the coming year regarding this recommendation. Meanwhile, you can prescribe it or tell your patients how to purchase it over-the-counter.
There’s definitely room for improvement in our clinical options for reducing the discomfort of IUD insertion. Add a comment below if you have a brilliant idea to test!

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisExcellent care for LGBTQ patientsHere's how to be part of the solution when it comes to the health disparities LGBTQ people face.by Yvonne Piper, MLIS, MS, RN, FNPpublished 03/21/16#TransHealthFail. These are brief anecdotes from trans folks describing bad health care interactions that were bumbling at best, discriminatory or hurtful at worst. Stories like these are part of what motivates me to do better as a health care provider.
Why we should care
We’ve known for a long time that lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people have health disparities compared to heterosexual and cis-gendered people. (Don’t know all these terms? Check out this primer.) LGBTQ people in general and trans folks in particular are medically vulnerable, and bad interactions with providers make them less likely to access care, amplifying this vulnerability. Fearing a negative interaction with a provider, having to educate a provider on gender, or having been denied care in the past may understandably make someone postpone getting needed care.
Healthy People 2020 has made proposals to address health disparities for LGBTQ folks.
For health care providers, two of these proposals are of particular interest:
Encourage regular use of care by learning how to appropriately inquire about and be supportive of patients’ gender, sex, and orientation.
Increase culturally competent medical care by ensuring that trainees interact with LGBTQ patients.
Let’s translate these goals into some practical tips for interacting with patients and improving clinic systems.
Interacting with LGBTQ patients
Ask rather than assume.
You may make a mistake when trying to identify someone’s sex, gender, or orientation. The last one is perhaps a feeling providers know – you may be able to recall a time when you made an incorrect assumption. How did you handle that? You may have been taken aback, or felt embarrassed, and (hopefully!) you apologized to your patient when they pointed out your error.
How might you have prevented this oversight? By asking. There are plenty of opportunities to ask. Perhaps your new patient paperwork asks patients to identify all of these things: sex at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation, and preferred pronouns.
(More details on paperwork below.)
If your records don’t have a spot for this information, talk with your colleagues about how to address this.
If you know someone whose clinic is doing a good job of this, ask to see their forms. A good goal is a system to collect this information once and share it with all the people involved in your patients’ care. You shouldn’t be asking at every single visit.
Use the information your patients give you. Don’t collect it if you’re not going to use it! You should be using patients’ preferred names for every encounter, whether you’re inviting someone to an exam room, starting a conversation, or booking a future appointment.
Don't assume sex/gender/identity are clinically relevant.
When your typical cis-gendered patient comes in for cough or flu care, do you ask about their sex or gender?
Nope.
And you shouldn’t ask LGBTQ patients presenting for this type of routine care either.
Trust your patients to tell you if something about their sex/gender/identity is relevant to their current health care needs.
Making your clinic’s systems work for trans patients
What are some ways you can let LGBTQ patients know that you are a welcoming place for them to access health care?
Some things are easy and some things take more time to shift.
Update your new patient forms. Folks who identify as transgender or gender-variant often encounter barriers to care in the most basic place, like your new patient intake forms. Here are some ways to make these types of forms more inclusive:
Name. Many folks, cis and trans, have preferred names that differ from their legal names. Making this distinction on your paperwork can go a long way to making your patients feel more comfortable. Provide spaces for legal name and preferred name. Avoid using “nickname.”
Sex. Provide multiple options: male, female, intersex, and a spot for patients to choose their own term.
Also, make sure the form correctly identifies these terms as sex rather than gender.
Gender. You may also want to include gender as a separate category.
Options here could be cis, trans MTF, trans FTM, agender, genderqueer and a write-in option.
Orientation. Options here could be heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or gay, and a write-in.
Preferred pronouns. Options here could be she/her, he/him, and a write-in to let patients identify any other preferred terms.
Write-in options are key: there are way too many variations to cover them all with check boxes!
Update your electronic health records. This is the holy grail of accurately sharing a patient’s name, sex, gender, orientation, and preferred pronoun information.
Also make sure you can use your EHR to track preventive screenings like Pap tests and breast exams for patients who have the relevant tissue, regardless of their sex/gender labels.
You’ll need to work with your IT team to make these changes, and you may be able to model it on your improved intake forms.
EHR companies are starting to get more of these requests, so they may offer out-of-the-box solutions for your clinic.
Improve your bathroom signage. If your bathrooms are intended for single-occupancy, an easy fix is to switch to gender-neutral signs.
If you have multi-stall bathrooms, check out these creative suggestions.
Learn how to bill health care plans. Sometimes even getting basic or preventive care covered is a hassle for trans patients.
Check with the relevant health plans about how to bill for services when they may or may not agree with a patient’s birth sex listed on the plan.
You should ask patients whether they have any confidentiality concerns regarding their explanation of benefits forms.
If yes, you may be able to code in a way that helps patients maintain confidentiality while getting access to the care they need (e.g. “endocrine disorder NOS” instead of “gender dysphoria”).
Educate your colleagues
People have a lot of questions and misconceptions about these issues, and it may take time and effort to bring about these changes in your clinic or practice.
Here are some steps you can take:
Share toolkits and guidelines for trans health care with your colleagues.
Watch a video about trans health care at your next staff meeting.
Have staff take a webinar to learn from experts on this topic.
Once you have become an amazing LGBTQ provider, you can list your practice at MyTransHealth and RadRemedy.
When word spreads in the community that you are a compassionate and culturally competent provider, you will start seeing more LGBTQ patients—and contributing to the national goal of reducing LGBTQ health disparities.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisU=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable)Talking to your patients with HIV about their transmission riskby Mari Lowe, NP-Cpublished 04/15/19People living with HIV often have questions about the risk of passing HIV to their negative partners. Good news--recent research has shown that patients who use antiretroviral therapy (ART) to maintain consistently undetectable levels of HIV are effectively unable to transmit HIV to their sexual partners. HIV treatment with ARTs as transmission prevention, commonly referred to as “Undetectable = Untransmittable,” or U=U, is treatment as prevention (TasP) and is gaining traction in preventing new HIV cases.
As U=U has grown in popularity, the term has popped up outside of the exam room. For example, people with undetectable viral loads may include the abbreviations U=U, tasp, or [u+] in their dating profiles, to inform potential partners of their virally suppressed status.
Here are the basics on U=U that providers need to know:
How does U=U prevent HIV transmission?
If a person adheres to their ART regimen and has an undetectable HIV viral load, they have effectively no risk
of passing the HIV virus to anyone through sex—oral, anal, or vaginal.
To take it back to basics—once someone is infected with HIV, the virus begins multiplying in the body. With HIV treatment, an ART regimen stops the virus from multiplying, and ultimately suppresses the viral load so low that it is “undetectable.” This usually happens within one to six months on consistent ART for most patients.
What’s the evidence for U=U?
Support for U=U comes predominantly from four studies:
HPTN 052, PARTNER, PARTNER 2, and Opposites Attract. These studies followed HIV serodiscordant couples (one HIV-positive, one HIV-negative), including male-male couples and female-male couples. The researchers examined rates of HIV transmission from ART-adherent HIV-positive partners with undetectable viral loads to HIV-negative partners during sexual activity without a condom. The researchers across the studies found zero transmissions of HIV from the HIV-positive partner to the HIV-negative partner. In December 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began supporting HIV treatment as prevention.
When talking with your patients about U=U, it’s important to emphasize a few key points:
1. U=U assumes patients are taking ART exactly as prescribed.
Missing even a few doses of ART can increase the HIV viral load, so it’s important to take ART exactly as prescribed, every day for it to be effective. Supporting people to take ART can include reminder apps, support networks, and behavioral counseling. People with undetectable viral loads should continue with routine follow up, management, and health maintenance, usually every 3-6 months after viral suppression is achieved.
Before relying solely on U=U for HIV transmission prevention, patients should both:
Be on ART for at least seven months
AND
Have a confirmed viral load less than 200 copies/ml for at least six consecutive months
2. U=U does not prevent transmission of other STIs or prevent pregnancy.
It can be easy for patients and providers to forget that treating HIV doesn’t reduce transmission of other STIs or prevent pregnancy. The best way to reduce the risk of STIs is to use condoms with all sex, which includes oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Continue to screen all patients for STIs based on CDC guidelines, regardless of HIV status and offer STI testing based on history.
Patients not currently seeking to get pregnant should be offered birth control counseling and methods. Client-centered contraceptive counseling for people living with HIV requires knowledge of what ART medications they are using, since there are some caveats.
3. There are complementary strategies for serodiscordant couples.
Whether or not a person’s HIV viral load is undetectable, you should counsel the patient about condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) based on their history.
Bottom Line:
U=U is an exciting addition to the current line-up of HIV transmission reduction strategies currently endorsed by the CDC. U=U can improve the sex lives of people living with HIV and their partners. As a health care provider, even if you are not managing HIV treatment, knowing the how and why behind U=U strengthens your conversations with patients and improves the sexual health of all our patients, regardless of HIV status.

IUD) introduced in 2015. But you and your patients may still be trying to sort out how Liletta is different from—or very similar to—another IUD that’s been out there for years, the Mirena. Here are the details.
How long does Liletta actually last?
As of late 2018, the official word from the FDA is that Liletta effectively prevents pregnancy for up to five years. But that’s just a start. Liletta was designed to last seven years, and the study testing its effectiveness will be ongoing through 2020. To date, the study has shown that the pregnancy rate is very low (0.55%) for up to five years of use. Another study looking at the amount of levonorgestrel released by the IUS through five years of use suggests that it’s on track for a seven-year lifespan.
So what can you tell your patients now? You can reassure them that if they reach the three or five-year mark (depending on the what information was available when it was placed) and want to keep their Liletta, the FDA will likely have approved a longer lifespan by that time. Check out this article to read more about talking to your patients about the updated FDA approval.
How easy is Liletta to place?
The early adopters out there may remember that the original Liletta inserter was a bit clunky—sort of a hybrid between other inserters we love or hate. The current inserter, now widely available, is remarkably similar to the inserters you’re used to with other hormonal IUDs. Liletta’s inserter even has numbers on it to remind you of the steps for placement. Although the slider is a bit stiff, the placement process will be very familiar to anyone who has placed a hormonal IUD in the past. It’s also reloadable and easily learned by a new health care provider.
How should I counsel my patients about Mirena versus Liletta?
In terms of the patient experience of the device, the truth is that they are likely the same. Both are excellent at preventing pregnancy, and both are likely to cause noticeable decreases in menstrual bleeding or even complete cessation. The amount of levonorgestrel delivered is basically the same over the first five years, resulting in similar side effect and benefit profiles. Even the inserters and placement processes are now similar. From your patient’s perspective, the biggest difference between the two may be the cost.
How much will my patient pay for a Liletta?
Cost is the only place where there may be a profound difference between the two devices. Liletta is the result of a unique partnership with women’s health advocates, researchers, and a not-for-profit drug company to develop an affordable IUD. Throughout the process, Liletta’s makers have been committed to ensuring the device is broadly accessible, even to those without health insurance and those with high deductibles. Their goal is that no one will ever have to pay more than $150 for a Liletta.
How do I get reimbursed for Liletta?
If your practice should be reimbursed by a third-party payer for a Liletta, there is a J-code specific to this IUD. For additional tips on reimbursement and coding, check out this comprehensive resource: Intrauterine Devices & Implants: a Guide to Reimbursement.
Overall, Liletta is a welcome option for patients interested in hormonal contraception.
As a provider, I feel good about being able to offer patients who want an IUD an effective, safe, and affordable option—regardless of their health care coverage.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisIUDs, STIs, and PID: What’s the deal?Contrary to popular myth, modern IUDs don't cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).by Sara Kennedy, MD, MPHpublished 07/11/13There’s a lot of conflicting information out there about the relationship between these three very important acronyms related to women’s health: intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and a serious infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Some health care providers with out-of-date information refuse to give young women or women without children an IUD for fear of STIs and PID. As we’ve pointed out before, science tells us that this is just plain wrong: women can safely use an IUD regardless of age or how many babies they’ve had.
How did we get here?
IUDs got a bad rap back in the 1970s when a poorly designed IUD called the Dalkon Shield caused PID for some women and failed to prevent pregnancies for others.
The Dalkon Shield made women more vulnerable to infections of the uterus, and a few women using it died from severe infections.
The makers of the Dalkon Shield didn't test it for safety and effectiveness the way we now test IUDs.
Thousands of women filed lawsuits against the makers and they went bankrupt—and their IUD has not been sold in the U.S. for almost 40 years.
The Dalkon Shield earned its bad reputation, but other IUDs have not. The IUDs currently available in the U.S.—progestin IUDs Mirena, Skyla, and Liletta and non-hormonal IUD ParaGard—have been extensively tested for safety and effectiveness. All types of IUDs have been studied for years by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Large studies have definitively proven that modern IUDs do not cause PID.
Where do STIs fit into this story?
Here’s what does cause PID: STIs. The most common STIs in the U.S. are Chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Whether a woman gets an STI depends on her sexual partners and whether they use condoms—which are still the champ for preventing STIs (and, by extension, PID). We now know that women using modern IUDs are no more likely to get an STI or PID than women using other types of birth control.
Getting an IUD soon? GYT. If a woman has an undiagnosed STI at the time an IUD is placed in the uterus, she is at a higher risk of getting PID. This is why health care providers often require that you take an STI test before getting one. This is especially likely if you are under age 26, have a new sexual partner, or have multiple partners—because all these groups are at higher risk of having an STI.
Highway out of the danger zone. About 20 days after having an IUD inserted, a woman is past the danger zone for developing PID from an STI she didn’t know she had during the insertion. After that time, PID happens at the same rate for women using IUDs as for those using other methods of birth control (aside from condoms).
But I’ve already been tested, doc. New research shows that women can safely be tested for STIs on the day an IUD is placed. For the few women who discover that they have an STI when the test results come back, they can take antibiotics to cure the infection and leave the IUD in place. Women with one exclusive sexual partner who have already been tested and cleared may even be able to get an IUD without STI screening.
Methods with benefits. There is even some evidence that the hormonal IUD (Mirena) protects against PID over time. Researchers think this might be because this IUD works by thickening cervical mucus, which makes it difficult for sperm—or an STI—to enter the uterus.
What happens if you do get an STI once you have an IUD?
STIs happen. If a woman using an IUD does get an STI, she can safely leave the IUD in place while getting treated. Even a woman who develops PID may be able to leave the IUD in place during treatment—although this is definitely something she’d want to consult a health care provider about.
Why are some people still worried about IUDs?
The short answer is that things change slowly. Doctors and nurses who were working in the 1970s and 80s still remember the bad rap of the Dalkon Shield. In those decades, influential medical organizations said IUDs were not safe. Younger doctors and nurses were taught to have the same concerns. It wasn’t until the 1990s and 2000s that we had conclusive information about the safety of IUDs, and it has only been in the last few years that medical organizations have updated their information. So this newer information about the safety of IUDs just hasn’t reached all health care providers yet. The same is true for friends, family, and the internet.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisStarting birth control after using ‘ella’ for ECHere’s what you need to know to help your patients balance risks and uncertainties related to starting hormonal birth control after ella.by Kelly Cleland, MPA, MPHpublished 01/11/17In March 2015, the FDA changed the label for one brand of emergency contraception (EC)—ulipristal acetate (UPA), sold as ella. The new label warned against starting a hormonal birth control method within 5 days of taking UPA. Why the change, and what does this mean for your practice?
The concern behind the ella label change
Since UPA is an anti-progestin, the concern is that using birth control containing a progestin right after taking it may make the UPA less effective. The study that prompted the label change showed that women who used UPA, then started a progestin-only pill (POP) the next day had higher rates of ovulation compared to women who used UPA then started a placebo pill (45% of cycles vs. just 3%). This is compelling evidence that starting this particular type of POP—one containing desogestrel—reduces UPA’s effectiveness. It’s such a big reduction in effectiveness that women may face the same risk of pregnancy as if they had used no EC at all.
But there are important limits to what we can learn from this study:
Desogestrel POPs work differently from other types of POPs.
Although widely used in Europe, desogestrel POPs are not available in the United States. We have only POPs containing norethindrone, and we don’t know if these pills would have the same impact on UPA.
We also don’t know if other forms of progestin-only birth control, like the implant, the shot, and hormonal IUDs would have the same impact on UPA.
What does this mean for my patients?
Guidelines used to recommend that patients start birth control immediately after any kind of EC. But in 2016, the CDC recommended that women begin hormonal birth control no sooner than 5 days after taking UPA. They don’t rule out starting the implant, the shot, or a hormonal IUD on the same day as UPA, but they say we should weigh the possible risk of decreased UPA effectiveness against the future risk of pregnancy for women who don’t start these birth control methods. This still leaves a lot of gray area for providers and patients!
At the American Society for Emergency Contraception we’ve tried to take into account factors that impact an individual’s risk of pregnancy in order to offer a more nuanced approach. When you’re counseling EC patients who want to start using hormonal birth control, here are some points to consider:
Is a non-hormonal IUD an option? Although it’s not for everyone, we can remind patients that the copper IUD is the most effective EC and offers ongoing protection.
Is UPA even available? Although UPA has been available in the U.S. since 2010, it is not always on hand or in stock at local pharmacies.
What is this patient’s risk of pregnancy? Only people who had sex close to the time of ovulation are at high risk of a pregnancy. Consider whether your patient’s risk is greater from the act of intercourse that already occurred, or from future sex acts.
Could this patient return for a follow-up visit? The complex circumstances of your patient’s life may mean that it’s difficult, or impossible, for them to return 5 days later.
Does your patient need EC because they were late with a pill, patch, or ring? This is a common reason for needing EC. Patients in this situation should be advised to use LNG, rather than UPA, for EC. (And if your patient is having difficulty using their method consistently, you may also want to discuss lower-maintenance birth control options for the future.)
If you rule out a non-hormonal IUD and talk through these other issues, you will likely find that one of these approaches is a good fit:
1) UPA plus ongoing contraception. Provide UPA EC and work with your patient to choose a birth control method to use going forward. Set an appointment for your patient to start the implant, the shot, or an IUD 5 days after the last act of unprotected sex. Or if your patient selected the pill, the patch, or the ring, dispense the new method and set up a reminder to start taking it 5 days after the last act of unprotected sex. Advise your patient to use a back-up method for the next 7 days.
This is a first-choice option when: UPA is available, and the patient is at high risk for pregnancy from the act of intercourse that already occurred and likely to return for a follow-up visit if needed.
2) Levonorgestrel EC plus immediate start of ongoing contraception. Provide LNG EC and immediately begin the patient’s selected contraceptive method. Advise your patient to use a back-up method for the next 7 days.
This is a first-choice option when: UPA is not available, and the patient is at relatively low risk for pregnancy from the act of intercourse that already occurred and is not likely to return for a follow-up visit, and/or is seeking EC because of missed or delayed pills, patch, or ring.
The bottom line
There is still much that we don’t know about how hormonal birth control impacts EC effectiveness. We hope that new studies will clarify how other types of birth control interact with UPA. For now, providers and patients must make the best decisions with the information we have. We hope the approaches described here will help you to balance the risk of pregnancy and the scientific uncertainties.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisRacism in family planning careHere’s what we can all do to break the cycle.by Andrea Jackson, MDpublished 06/29/16Today in the United States we see a resurgence of the discussion around our country’s oldest problem: racism. Whether we’re talking about how communities of color are being over-policed and disproportionately imprisoned, or the continuation of economic inequality, it’s clear that institutional racism is an unyielding problem in our society.
It is also our shame as a nation, and this shame prevents us from tackling the problem head on.
We in the family planning community have our own complicated history with racism, including:
Forced sterilization of women with mental illnesses, poor women, women of color, and Hispanic immigrant women—as recently as the 1970s.
Experimentation without informed consent on Puerto Rican women in the development of the oral contraceptive.
Coercion of poor women, who in the U.S. are disproportionately women of color, to use long-acting contraceptives (LARC) like Norplant and Depo-Provera in order to receive social assistance.
While most current policies are not intentionally targeting poor women and women of color, this legacy has formed a collective memory in many communities. Our patients from these communities may fear that modern family planning programs are a form of genocide.
History is alive
This collective memory may explain why, on average, black women report lower use of contraception compared to whites, and lower use of modern contraceptives including IUDs and implants. It may also affect some women’s preferences for avoiding methods that change menstruation or require a visit with a provider to stop using them.
It is not just patient behaviors stemming from historical racism that drive these differences in reproductive health care outcomes: we too contribute, in our roles as health care providers. In our enthusiasm to provide access to contraception to women whom we feel need it most, we may unwittingly continue the legacy of differential treatment, care, and counseling regarding family planning.
Here’s a current example.
Some family planning programs have started using percentage of contraceptive patients initiating LARC as an indicator of quality of care.
This may seem like a benign policy and—from a biomedical perspective—a good one, since LARCs are the most effective methods. But most family planning clinics are located in communities with concentrations of low-income women and women of color. That means we as providers may be perceived as targeting these women to use LARC, and possibly even pushing it, because we are being incentivized to increase the percent of women initiating LARC. If the incentive were to give unbiased, complete contraceptive counseling and then give the method that the patient desires, this quality indicator would feel very different.
Unconscious biases: you have them
Indeed, studies have shown that we providers, when presented with patients with varying combinations of apparent education, income level, and race/ethnicity, are more likely to recommend IUDs to poor women and women of color compared to wealthier women and white women.
This reality of our unconscious biases may be the reason that studies show black women tend to rate their quality of family planning care as low. The same study showed that black women felt pressured by their providers to use contraception, and other studies have shown they felt pressured to limit their reproductive potential.
Breaking the cycle
If women do not feel comfortable receiving care from us, they will not seek out needed health care, leading to a continuation of poor reproductive and other health outcomes. So how do we as providers break this vicious cycle?
By doing three things:
Learn about and acknowledge our history of reproductive abuse in family planning.
While painful, without this education for our current and future family planning leaders, we will continue to make the same mistakes.
Never allow group statistics to determine how we treat an individual patient. This phenomenon is called statistical discrimination.
For example, while it is true on average that women of color have higher rates of unintended pregnancies and contraceptive misuse, we should not allow that fact to creep into individual interactions with our patients.
This is the doorway that our unconscious biases and stereotypes creep through, and we then fail to provide patient-centered care. Remaining open and curious about each individual patient's experience helps to avoid statistical discrimination.
Take a lesson from our reproductive justice colleagues: trust your patient.
Even if it seems like a decision you would not make for yourself if you were in her shoes, remember that you do not have all the information she does—she’s the expert on her life.
Let’s also remember our oath to be caring, empathic, and supportive medical providers and empower our patients to make their own decisions.
So many of us providers are in this for the right reasons: we want to be the people who help patients achieve their health and overall life goals.
Like our painful but critically important national conversation about race and equity, health care providers are due for some of the same hard and fruitful reflections and conversations.
Let’s take these steps to ensure that patients of color and poor patients achieve true reproductive health equity within our generation.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisSTI-status sharing: Online resources for your patientsHave a patient who's uncomfortable notifying partners about a positive STI diagnosis? These online resources can help.published 07/22/16By Jill Eversole in consultation with Bhupendra Sheoran, Executive Director of YTH.
When it comes to STIs, of course you want to encourage patients to get tested regularly (and to practice safe sex). But what if testing results in a positive STI diagnosis? You may be able to support your patient not only in getting further testing or treatment as appropriate, but also in notifying current and past partners. Online resources make it easier than ever to let partners know about a positive STI diagnosis, often while providing further information about that STI and where to get tested.
Why it matters…
While it can be uncomfortable to contact partners about STI exposure, it is incredibly important. Partner notification is a critical component of reducing the spread of STIs. Bhupendra Sheoran, Executive Director of YTH, says: “Partner notification is a valuable strategy for breaking the chain of STI/STD infection and reducing morbidity. With the Internet becoming a key platform for social networking and hooking-up, using online contact information is a critical method to make sexual partners aware of STD risk. Online partner notification does not replace but instead supplements traditional partner notification strategies and has the potential to make a significant impact in early detection, treatment and prevention of STDs.”
If your patient is interested in notifying partners in person, you could refer them to this resource from The STD Project.
Another option is for your patient to disclose their status using an online service.
Here are a few online services we think are worth checking out and potentially worth sharing with your patients.
So They Can Know
So They Can Know is a website created by Sexual Health Innovations to help users alert sexual partners about potential STI exposure. Users have the option to anonymously send an email that will inform the recipient about which STI(s) they may have been exposed to, how that STI is spread, and where they can get tested. For now, it only works with three STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis.
So They Can Know also has tools to support users who prefer to notify their partner(s) directly, such as scripts for how to talk with, call, text, or email someone “so they can know they need to get tested” for an STI. So They Can Know also provides information on STIs, risk assessment, and STI risk reduction, including details on condoms and other safer sex supplies.
inSPOT
inSPOT lets users send e-cards to past and current sexual partners about STI exposure. Users have the option to add a short personal message or send the cards anonymously. They can email up to six partners simultaneously to tell them they should get tested. The user can select the specific STI from a list of twelve STIs or go with a general “get tested” message. Users can also learn more about STIs and find a nearby clinic for STI testing and treatment on the inSPOT website. Plus, inSPOT is available in seven different countries and three languages—English, Spanish, and French.
Don’t Spread It
Don’t Spread It allows users to anonymously email or text a sexual partner with information about the STI they may have been exposed to. Users need to create an account (but don’t have to include any personal or contact information), select one (or more) STIs from a list of thirteen, and enter the recipient’s email or phone number. That person will get an email or text with a link to the Don’t Spread It website, where they can find additional information on the selected STI, common symptoms, and where to find a clinic. The whole process is quick, easy, and incognito.
Healthvana
Healthvana is a patient engagement platform that uses digital tools to help providers better communicate with patients, which then allows patients to better communicate with their partners about STI status. Providers and clinics can integrate Healthvana into their lab and EHR systems, so that patients receive an automatic notification when their lab results are ready (including STI results). Patients can quickly access their results by logging into their account (online or through the Healthvana app), along with educational information about their results, next steps, and any additional testing reminders. Healthvana’s creators hope that by providing quick digital access to STI testing results, users will be able to immediately share test results with a partner.

Years of research went into the creation of Bedsider. Many more years have been spent raising awareness of our program among our target demographic of women age 18 to 29. Time and time again, we were told that people loved Bedsider for its engaging, approachable tone and useful content and tools. The next logical step was to assess the effectiveness of our work. So, in 2014, we initiated a professional, independent, random assignment evaluation of our program.
The results are in and we are pleased to share the news that Bedsider is the first digital intervention in reproductive health in the U.S.—with adults as an audience—that has shown to prevent unplanned pregnancy.
Among women age 18 to 29 who participated in the yearlong randomized controlled trial:
Women in the Bedsider group were 1.51 times less likely to have a pregnancy scare than those in the control group.
Women in the Bedsider group were 2.54 times less likely to have unprotected sex.
Women in the Bedsider group were 3.79 times less likely to report an unplanned pregnancy.
Women in the Bedsider group were also more likely to use a more effective method of contraception.
The full report, which was published in Social Marketing Quarterly, can be downloaded at your convenience.
This affirmation of our work is driving us forward and we invite you to be a part of it as Power to Decide, the campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy, continues its on-going learning and assessment of the Bedsider program. If you have an idea about a research project, please contact us.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisExciting News – LILETTA now approved for use up to 5 years! The FDA has extended approval of LILETTA IUDs for up to 5 years of use, research shows they are safe and effective for up to 7 years.
by Robin Watkins, CNM, WHNP-BCpublished 12/03/18On October 15, the FDA approved LILETTA, a 52mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) for up to 5 years of use. Here is what you need to know.
Why change to 5 years?
Current research shows that an IUD with 52mg of levonorgestrel, like LILETTA, is effective and safe to use for up to 5 years. Additional evidence suggests that they are effective up to 7 years. The science showing that IUDs are effective beyond the original FDA approval continues to improve as time passes and it is possible to study them for longer periods of time. The manufacturers of LILETTA designed their clinical trial testing effectiveness to extend through 7 years and that research is ongoing through 2020.
Counseling patients who are having LILETTA placed
When you are placing IUDs and implants, a conversation about the discrepancy between the FDA approval and the evidence can be tricky and potentially long-winded! However, if you already know from conversations with your patients what is most important to them about their birth control method, you may not have to delve into a 1hr CME on the FDA. While these methods are shown to be effective beyond the FDA usage and patients may desire to use them up to the maximum, evidence shows
that the average duration of use tends to be much less. This is a great opportunity to engage your patient in shared decision-making about their birth control.
General Counseling Points
Liletta is currently FDA approved for 5 years
Good evidence shows that an IUD with 52mg levonorgestrel is safe and effective for up to 7 years
Printed package materials may not match current FDA approval and/or current research
Patients can always come in to have their IUD strings checked, discuss satisfaction, and talk about how long they plan to use an IUD
Counseling patients who already have a LILETTA
You may have had this conversation with your patients about LILETTA and anticipated expanded FDA approval when you placed their LILETTA. Patients presenting for removal of LILETTA IUDs after 3
or 4 years may not feel comfortable continuing to use their method beyond the FDA approved maximum. It is reasonable to replace an IUD at that time or at any time that your patient requests removal.
LILETTA: the background
There are currently four levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs on the market: LILETTA (52mg), Mirena (52mg), Skyla (13.5mg) and Kyleena (19.5mg). Both LILETTA and Mirena have 52mg of levonorgestrel, making them very similar in practice.
However, LILETTA is unique in that it was brought to market in 2015 and manufactured by Medicines360, a non-profit pharmaceutical company working to improve access to the IUD for all women, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location. Clinics with 340B designation are able to purchase LILETTA for a discounted rate in order to make it accessible to more people who need it. You can find more information about LILETTA here, sign up for updates here, and find Bedsider materials for patients here.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisTalking fertility awareness methods with your patientsYou may have your doubts about FAM, but what if your patients want to use it?by Lisa Stern, MSN, APRNpublished 03/08/19Editor's update: Since this article was published, the FDA has approved the Natural Cycles app and basal body thermometer to prevent pregnancy as a Class II medical device. We know of at least two studies that have looked at the accuracy of period and fertility tracking apps. Here's what they found.
In the last few years, one of the most ancient contraceptive methods has taken a modern turn. At last count, there are over 200 fertility awareness method (FAM) mobile applications (“apps”) for measuring, monitoring, and tracking women’s cycles. Before we dive into the apps, here’s an oh-so-brief overview of FAM.
Practice pearls for patients using FAM
To prevent pregnancy, FAM depends on women being aware of their fertile and infertile periods. Users typically monitor basal body temperature and cervical secretions, count calendar days, and may use over-the-counter ovulation tests. FAM has gotten a bad rap, largely due to the Roman Catholic Church’s advocacy of the rhythm method. But when practiced carefully, FAM can have an unintended pregnancy rate as low as 2 to 5%. (More typically, the failure rate is about 12 to 25% annually.)
What, then, does careful practice mean? What can we recommend to patients? Here are some principles to keep in mind:
Understand the biological signs of fertility. The nuances of cervical secretion changes are beyond the scope of most sex ed classes. Your advice and resources like the classic Taking Charge of Your Fertility can help. Ultimately, it’s a good idea for women to take a couple of cycles to get to know their own bodily changes before relying on FAM alone to prevent pregnancy.
Know the backup plan. For some women and couples, periodic abstinence is their preferred backup. Others may use condoms or other barrier methods, the effectiveness of which can be enhanced through the use of spermicides. A growing body of research also points to withdrawal as a common method whose efficacy has perhaps been underestimated. Patients may want to have emergency contraception (EC) on hand for use as needed, or know where they can receive a copper IUD as EC. (Bonus: A copper IUD is the most effective EC option but also works as highly effective birth control for up to 12 years!)
Track fertile and infertile periods carefully. Though graph paper and a pencil have been successful for women and couples for decades (if not centuries), newer technologies may be helpful here.
It’s also helpful to remember that not all patients experience pregnancy planning as a categorical decision. Pregnancy ambivalence, or simply being open to pregnancy, is common among women and men of all ages, and FAM requires buy-in from both partners. Explore with your patients what they might do if they became pregnant. And if you want a deeper dive on FAM, the classic book Contraceptive Technology has an excellent chapter.
Apps for FAM
So, what about those hundreds of apps? There have been a few articles in the popular press that describe these apps and report on what they call the “return of the rhythm method.” These are interesting but don’t necessarily speak to the apps’ accuracy or user-friendliness. Below are some factors to consider in evaluating apps. You can take yourself on a self-guided tour of some of the most popular ones or simply recommend to patients that they consider the following questions:
Is the app effective and evidence-based? To us as providers, this is the crux of the matter. Unfortunately, this is one of the hardest features to evaluate. Most apps’ websites are silent or vague on this issue. Clue bills its app as “scientific,” but does not offer additional information about how its algorithm works or how accurate it is. NaturalCycles offers the most information about its scientific basis, and it sounds impressive: They report that “in 202,544 days of its service being used there have been zero unwanted pregnancies.” However, this is based on proprietary data, not a peer-reviewed publication, and most apps do not offer similar data with which to compare. iCycleBeads is based on the classic CycleBeads method of implementing the Standard Days Method, which has been well-evaluated.
Are you willing to pay for an app? Some apps shown as “free” lock their best features behind a paywall. For patients who don’t want to pay for an app, My Days is free and simple to use, as is Clue.
Is the app customizable? If you can personalize your music apps, why shouldn’t you be able to personalize something as personal as fertility? The popular app Glow allows users to choose which data points they wish to monitor and allows them to enter symptoms like breast tenderness. (Note that Glow is geared mostly at users trying to become pregnant). If your patient has irregular cycle length, her app must be able to account for this. Many, including iCycleBeads, cannot.
Is the app intended for pregnancy prevention, pregnancy planning, or both? One factor that makes FAM unique among family planning methods is that it can be used both to prevent and to plan pregnancy. This can be convenient and empowering for patients, who can continue to use FAM as their fertility desires change. However, for those focused on avoiding pregnancy, the apps geared at pregnancy may produce some discomfort. Fertility Friend, for instance, is mainly designed for women planning pregnancy. Kindara and OvuView (available for Android only) function well for both prevention and planning.
Ultimately, in the absence of scientific literature evaluating or comparing the apps (multi-arm RCT, anyone?), it’s impossible to make a truly evidence-based recommendation. But highlighting the above factors for patients and familiarizing yourself with a few good apps is a safe and appropriate adjunct to self-knowledge and clinical consultation.

Barar, MPHpublished 06/29/16If you have worked in contraceptive care in the last decade, you’ve probably seen at least one meeting or online course titled something like “Increasing LARC Access” or “Improving Delivery of IUD Care.” We know that IUDs and the implant—collectively known as long-acting reversible contraception or LARC—are used less in the U.S. than in other developed countries. We also know that unintended pregnancy rates are higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries.
So it makes sense that reducing barriers to providing and using LARC has been a U.S. public health priority for a decade.
Some health care providers and policymakers talk about LARC as if it were the only solution we need to the U.S.’s high unintended pregnancy rate. Some see the Contraceptive CHOICE Project in St. Louis, Missouri, as an example of how many U.S. women might want to use an IUD or implant if these methods were free. Fully 75% of the thousands of participants in the CHOICE Project chose an IUD or an implant.
But what do experts think would really happen to national LARC use if all the barriers were removed?
A team of researchers at University of California, San Francisco—including me—decided to ask.
We identified 154 LARC experts. These were people who had authored a peer-reviewed paper about LARC in any of three well-respected medical journals since 2013.
We invited these experts to participate in a 5-minute online survey about the future of LARC.
Question 1: What are the most important barriers to LARC use?
We first asked respondents to list the most important barriers to IUD and implant use. The top five were:
Cost of the device to patients (63%)
Lack of information about safety and acceptability (61%)
Patient’s fear of side effects (56%)
Concern about having the device placed (51%)
Lack of trained primary care providers (49%)
These barriers aren’t news to anyone working in contraceptive care, but it is worth noting that two of them—fear of side effects and concerns about having the device placed—can’t be fully dispelled with more funding or training for health care providers.
Question 2: How many women would use LARC?
Next, the experts estimated what proportion of women would use LARC if all of the barriers could be removed. While most experts agree that LARC use could be higher than the current 7%, most did not see it as the silver bullet that will eliminate unwanted pregnancy.
The majority of experts estimated that a maximum of around 25% of U.S. women would use an IUD or implant if all barriers to use were removed. While this would be more than triple the current LARC use, the experts agreed that even without the barriers, LARC users would remain a minority.
Question 3: Should we have policies to encourage LARC?
We also asked the LARC experts to react to a range of policies designed to either encourage health care providers to place LARC or encourage women to use LARC. Respondents were asked to consider policies based on real examples of past and current programs related to contraception, such as:
Financial incentives to encourage clinicians to place LARC methods.
Providing free LARC, but not other methods, to women receiving public assistance.
There was near universal support for women receiving public assistance being able to access all forms of contraception free of charge. As the policies became more potentially coercive, support dimmed to almost zero. For example, no one agreed with paying women to use LARC. Interestingly, male experts were four times more likely than female experts to support financial incentives to encourage providers to place LARC.
It will take more than LARC to meet all contraceptive needs
The truth is that there are still many barriers to accessing IUDs and implants in the U.S. There is still a potential for greater use of these methods, as the trend of rising use in the last decade has shown. But the experts clearly believe that LARC is no silver bullet.
To preserve a woman’s autonomy to choose the method of birth control that is right for her, we need to take a more balanced approach to reducing unplanned pregnancy. Yes, we need to work on making LARC methods more available to the women who want them. And we need to work on making other methods more accessible and affordable, like moving the birth control pill over-the-counter.

Here's what you should know to avoid an accidental pregnancy.by Merrie Warden, MD, MPHpublished 07/16/14If you are one of the 1.1 million people in the U.S. living with HIV or AIDS, you might have heard that your choices of birth control are limited. The good news is that many methods—including some of the most effective ones—should still work well for you. What you can use depends on whether you are taking anti-retroviral medicine (a.k.a. ARVs) and what your overall health is like. So let’s talk details.
I have HIV but I’m not on meds right now. What are my birth control options?
If you’re not taking medications for HIV, the sky’s the limit. You can use any method of birth control, including combined hormonal methods like the pill, the patch, the ring, or more effective methods like the shot, the implant, or the IUD. Just keep in mind that none of these methods prevent the transmission of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so it’s important to use condoms too.
Why use condoms + another method of birth control?
If you’re living with HIV or AIDS, using condoms every time you have sex can help protect you and your partner. Doubling up with condoms and another type of birth control is even better since:
Some birth control “side effects” may be a benefit for you. Some birth control methods can make your period lighter, less painful or go away altogether.
Others offer long-term prevention of certain types of cancer.
Peace of mind that you won’t have an accidental pregnancy feels good. If you’re relying on condoms for birth control, they can slip or break. And planning for pregnancy can give you the ability to have a healthy pregnancy when you want one: less than 1% of pregnant women with HIV give the virus to their babies when taking a special set of medications.
I’m taking HIV medication. What birth control can I use?
The shot, implant, and IUD are effective regardless of what HIV medication you’re on. Whether you can use other types of birth control depends on what type of medication you’re taking.
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs). If you’re taking a type of ARV called a “nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor,” like zidovudine or tenofovir, it’s safe to use any type of birth control, including combined hormonal methods like the pill, the patch, or the ring. The scientific evidence shows that these meds and birth control don’t mess with one another. Here’s a list of NRTIs to see if you’re taking one.
Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNTRIs). There’s some limited evidence that “non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors” like efavirenz or nevirapine may cause small changes in how the pill, patch, or ring is metabolized in your body, though they don’t appear to decrease the effectiveness of these methods. Here’s a list of NNTRIs to see if you’re taking one.
Protease inhibitors. If you’re taking a type of medication called a “protease inhibitor” like combinations of medications containing ritonavir, the medication may make the pill, patch, or ring less effective. Protease inhibitor meds may also mess with the progestin-only or mini pill.
There’s also some evidence that the pill, patch or ring changes how a protease inhibitor with ritonavir is broken down by the body.
These changes may make the medication more likely to cause minor problems with your liver or other side effects.
Always talk with your doctor about using any of these HIV medications with the pill, patch, or ring.
Here’s a list of protease inhibitors.
HIV makes me more vulnerable to infections. Is it safe to use an IUD?
IUDs are the most effective reversible birth control we have, and they do not increase the risk of a pelvic infection. In fact, this is a great method to use to prevent an accidental pregnancy while getting your body healthy on medications.
If you have HIV and are healthy, you can use any kind of IUD.
If you have AIDS, we usually recommend that you wait until your infection is under control before starting to use an IUD.
If you already have an IUD in place and develop AIDS, it is safe for you to keep using it.
I’ve heard that using the shot may increase the risk of transmitting HIV. Is that true?
Health researchers all over the world are working hard to make sure we have the right answer to this important question. It's possible that there is an association between using the shot and increased risk of getting HIV, but more evidence is needed. Current guidelines from the World Health Organization say that it's safe for HIV positive people to
use the shot, but that condoms should always be used to prevent HIV transmission.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisReproductive counseling in the age of Zika virusSex, contraception, pregnancy, fear… Here’s what health care providers can do for their patients.by Abigail Cutler, MDpublished 05/13/16*This article was updated on July 16, 2017, to reflect the most recent guidance and data.
The recent spread of the Zika virus, mainly a mosquito-borne illness, poses a possible threat to all women who may become pregnant. We now know that when contracted during pregnancy, the Zika virus causes microcephaly and other severe neurological defects in the developing fetus. It is also strongly associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction and pregnancy loss.
Recent research shows that Zika can be transmitted through sex, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. As of this writing, 5,381 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii, including 1,997 in pregnant women. Summer mosquito season is upon us and the types of mosquito that carry the virus (genus Aedes) are now firmly established in the U.S. Mosquito-borne transmission of Zika occurred in multiple states in the past year, and travel-associated Zika cases have been reported in most states.
Guidance is here
With news of Zika virus making headlines on a daily basis, health care providers face questions from patients who understandably fear Zika’s potential impact on their current or future pregnancies. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been developing guidance for patients and providers on an ongoing basis. The Office of Population Affairs (OPA) also created a handy toolkit for health care providers based on the CDC's guidance.
What we know (and don’t) about sexual transmission of Zika
We now know that the Zika virus can be transmitted during sex by both men and women infected with Zika in the absence of barrier protection—before, during and after the onset of symptoms such as fever. We also know that the virus is found in both blood and semen and seems to persist longer in semen. In one case, it was present in semen up to 62 days after the onset of fever. We do not yet know whether men and women without symptoms can spread the virus to their partners.
Future Zika research will likely address these gaps in our knowledge. In the meantime, the CDC recommends that men who live in or have traveled to areas with active Zika virus transmission either use a condom for every sex act or abstain from sexual intercourse with their partners for a specific duration of time. (Find those specific guidelines here.)
Pregnancy planning in the age of Zika
How should we respond when a patient asks how best to think about her reproductive life plans in the setting of Zika?
The public health concerns surrounding Zika virus transmission serve to remind us that all women of reproductive age need and deserve up-to-date, evidence-based, and bias-free information on the full range of contraception and family planning services in order to exercise full autonomy over their reproductive lives. For women who wish to avoid pregnancy in the setting of a Zika outbreak, health care providers should offer counseling on and access to all contraceptive methods.
If you have a patient who's not pregnant and has been exposed to Zika and shown symptoms, you can test to confirm the diagnosis and assure them that our best evidence suggests that a Zika infection is cleared by the body on its own. The current advice for females is to wait at least 8 weeks after exposure or onset of symptoms before attempting to get pregnant. Men who may have been exposed to Zika or who've been diagnosed with Zika infection should wait at least 6 months before attempting pregnancy, whether or not they've shown symptoms of infection. Currently, there is no evidence that Zika virus will cause poor pregnancy or infant outcomes in pregnancies conceived after the resolution of maternal infection, though our data is limited. If she has recently had unprotected sex, you should give her full counseling on her emergency contraception options.
If your patient is pregnant and worried about Zika—whether the pregnancy is wanted, unwanted, or she feels ambiguous about it—she is likely to have lots of questions. Be prepared to provide information on the potential risks to her fetus, the types of testing you’d recommend to monitor the pregnancy, and her pregnancy options.
All women, including those with Zika, deserve quality reproductive care
Decisions about pregnancy timing and planning are personal and complex, and counseling around these topics should be individualized. Regardless of our female patients’ exposure to Zika, we must ensure that they are supported in ways that respect their right to shared decision-making and safeguard their access to comprehensive reproductive health care. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourages comprehensive and patient-centered contraceptive and preconception counseling for all women at risk for or diagnosed with Zika infection. ACOG also offers online resources to help providers stay up-to-date with the latest evidence and guidelines.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisNobody’s perfect: Pill efficacy for the real worldOur patients shouldn’t have to be perfect to protect themselves from accidental pregnancy.by Colleen Krajewski, MD, MPHpublished 04/02/16It’s no secret that many women’s health care providers use IUDs, likely because they have the highest efficacy and continuation rates.
But the most common method of birth control among our patients remains the pill.
The pill is advertised as having 99% efficacy, but in real life we know that about it’s closer to 90%. That means about one in 10 women will have an unplanned pregnancy while using this method.
How can the advertised number and real life numbers be so different?
And what can we do to help our patients narrow the gap between these numbers?
Advertised numbers = “perfect use”
The advertised figures, also known as “perfect use” numbers, come from clinical trials of the method sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies making the product. The patients in these clinical trials are carefully screened; those with even minor medical problems or who use other medications are excluded.
These patients are highly motivated to avoid pregnancy, are being financially compensated for being in the study, and have frequent contact with study coordinators.
This is why the term “perfect use” really doesn’t tell the whole story.
It implies that it’s possible for a patient to replicate these efficacy rates in real life.
I prefer to use the term “theoretical use.” I tell my patients: “It’s possible in theory for the methods to work that well, but that’s not usually the case.”
Real-life numbers = “typical use”
The real life numbers, also known as “typical use” numbers, come from nationally representative surveys of women in the United States.
These surveys take a sample from the entire country, include a wide variety of women, and answer the question: “What percentage of couples will become pregnant while using these methods over the course of one year?”
This is much more applicable to my patient’s daily lives.
I prefer to use the term “real life” efficacy to describe these numbers.
Why is the theoretical different from real life pill efficacy?
Another way to ask this question is: “Why do women using the pill in the real world have a lower efficacy than those paid to be in research studies?” There are multiple possible answers, and patients have some common misconceptions about this.
Here are some of the reasons that the pill may not work as advertised:
Didn’t start a new pack on time.
Maybe the pharmacy was closed, or she just couldn’t get to the pharmacy, or she forgot to pick up a new script, or her insurance changed, or her refill order expired… You get the idea.
Skipped more than one pill.
Maybe she had something stressful disrupt her daily routine, or didn’t bring the pack while away from home, or she just plain forgot.
Had another health issue that interfered with absorption.
Maybe she had vomiting due to food poisoning or a hangover, or diarrhea from a course of antibiotics.
Took another medication that made the pill less effective.
While this is less common, there are medications that interfere with the pill.
Lost the pill pack.
It could be an accident like putting pills through the wash, or she could have a partner who interferes with her birth control.
Here are some of the misconceptions I hear from patients about why the pill doesn’t work as advertised:
“I took the pill a few hours late.”
While taking the combination pill every day is an important part of its efficacy, being a few hours off schedule does not meaningfully reduce its efficacy.
“I had to take antibiotics that messed with the pill.”
Most antibiotics don’t directly affect the pharmacokinetics of the pill.
The only exception is rifampin, which is rarely used in the U.S.
Because there are various factors affecting women’s ability to attain theoretical efficacy, we can’t predict which will happen to a specific patient.
Narrow the gap
Here are some things you can do to help narrow the gap between theoretical and real world efficacy:
Prescribe more than one month of pills at a time. If you write a prescription for 365 days, your patient can get access to 13 packs at once. Research shows that having a year’s supply substantially increases continuation and reduces unintended pregnancy.
You can also write a 3 month prescription with four refills (Disp #3, Refill #4) which is a total of 15 months of coverage.
Offer advance provision of emergency contraception (EC) and a back-up method like condoms to all your birth control patients.
Talk with patients about the ways that pill formulations may affect efficacy.
Formulations with fewer placebo pills or ones designed for continuous use may improve efficacy.
Make sure patients know about other methods, especially those whose theoretical-use efficacy and real-life efficacy are basically the same, like IUDs and the implant.
Here are some things your patient can do:
Use Bedsider reminders. A patient can download Bedsider's free app to get fun reminders to take the pill each day.
Keep the pill packet someplace where she’ll see it every day. This could be next to a toothbrush, the coffee machine, or next to her wallet or transit pass in her bag.
When trouble strikes, double up with condoms.
We can never predict when food poisoning may hit, or when stress may result in a missed pill—and condoms are an essential back up method for the next seven days.
There are lots of benefits to using the pill, including lighter periods, clearer skin, fewer ovarian cysts, reduced menstrual pain, and a long-lasting reduction in the risk of uterine cancer.
Whatever reason a patient has for using the pill, I like equipping her with multiple tools to help her succeed.

A patient’s typical use also influences efficacy.
Bedsider provides free birth control reminders for the pill, patch, ring, and shot to keep patients on time and on track, including when to get their prescription refilled. We deliver original reminder content through a smartphone app. For patients who require a discreet option, patients can select a reminder that never even references birth control. We also allow users to create a custom reminder which they can write themselves in whatever language they prefer. Patients simply download the app, enter their method, and schedule whichever type of reminder (clever, discreet, or custom) they prefer.
Appointment reminders are provided as well. And we’ve also launched a program where Providers can offer customized reminders with a clinic name and phone number. For more information, send us an email at providers@bedsider.org.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisTalking fertility awareness methods with your patientsYou may have your doubts about FAM, but what if your patients want to use it?by Lisa Stern, MSN, APRNpublished 03/08/19Editor's update: Since this article was published, the FDA has approved the Natural Cycles app and basal body thermometer to prevent pregnancy as a Class II medical device. We know of at least two studies that have looked at the accuracy of period and fertility tracking apps. Here's what they found.
In the last few years, one of the most ancient contraceptive methods has taken a modern turn. At last count, there are over 200 fertility awareness method (FAM) mobile applications (“apps”) for measuring, monitoring, and tracking women’s cycles. Before we dive into the apps, here’s an oh-so-brief overview of FAM.
Practice pearls for patients using FAM
To prevent pregnancy, FAM depends on women being aware of their fertile and infertile periods. Users typically monitor basal body temperature and cervical secretions, count calendar days, and may use over-the-counter ovulation tests. FAM has gotten a bad rap, largely due to the Roman Catholic Church’s advocacy of the rhythm method. But when practiced carefully, FAM can have an unintended pregnancy rate as low as 2 to 5%. (More typically, the failure rate is about 12 to 25% annually.)
What, then, does careful practice mean? What can we recommend to patients? Here are some principles to keep in mind:
Understand the biological signs of fertility. The nuances of cervical secretion changes are beyond the scope of most sex ed classes. Your advice and resources like the classic Taking Charge of Your Fertility can help. Ultimately, it’s a good idea for women to take a couple of cycles to get to know their own bodily changes before relying on FAM alone to prevent pregnancy.
Know the backup plan. For some women and couples, periodic abstinence is their preferred backup. Others may use condoms or other barrier methods, the effectiveness of which can be enhanced through the use of spermicides. A growing body of research also points to withdrawal as a common method whose efficacy has perhaps been underestimated. Patients may want to have emergency contraception (EC) on hand for use as needed, or know where they can receive a copper IUD as EC. (Bonus: A copper IUD is the most effective EC option but also works as highly effective birth control for up to 12 years!)
Track fertile and infertile periods carefully. Though graph paper and a pencil have been successful for women and couples for decades (if not centuries), newer technologies may be helpful here.
It’s also helpful to remember that not all patients experience pregnancy planning as a categorical decision. Pregnancy ambivalence, or simply being open to pregnancy, is common among women and men of all ages, and FAM requires buy-in from both partners. Explore with your patients what they might do if they became pregnant. And if you want a deeper dive on FAM, the classic book Contraceptive Technology has an excellent chapter.
Apps for FAM
So, what about those hundreds of apps? There have been a few articles in the popular press that describe these apps and report on what they call the “return of the rhythm method.” These are interesting but don’t necessarily speak to the apps’ accuracy or user-friendliness. Below are some factors to consider in evaluating apps. You can take yourself on a self-guided tour of some of the most popular ones or simply recommend to patients that they consider the following questions:
Is the app effective and evidence-based? To us as providers, this is the crux of the matter. Unfortunately, this is one of the hardest features to evaluate. Most apps’ websites are silent or vague on this issue. Clue bills its app as “scientific,” but does not offer additional information about how its algorithm works or how accurate it is. NaturalCycles offers the most information about its scientific basis, and it sounds impressive: They report that “in 202,544 days of its service being used there have been zero unwanted pregnancies.” However, this is based on proprietary data, not a peer-reviewed publication, and most apps do not offer similar data with which to compare. iCycleBeads is based on the classic CycleBeads method of implementing the Standard Days Method, which has been well-evaluated.
Are you willing to pay for an app? Some apps shown as “free” lock their best features behind a paywall. For patients who don’t want to pay for an app, My Days is free and simple to use, as is Clue.
Is the app customizable? If you can personalize your music apps, why shouldn’t you be able to personalize something as personal as fertility? The popular app Glow allows users to choose which data points they wish to monitor and allows them to enter symptoms like breast tenderness. (Note that Glow is geared mostly at users trying to become pregnant). If your patient has irregular cycle length, her app must be able to account for this. Many, including iCycleBeads, cannot.
Is the app intended for pregnancy prevention, pregnancy planning, or both? One factor that makes FAM unique among family planning methods is that it can be used both to prevent and to plan pregnancy. This can be convenient and empowering for patients, who can continue to use FAM as their fertility desires change. However, for those focused on avoiding pregnancy, the apps geared at pregnancy may produce some discomfort. Fertility Friend, for instance, is mainly designed for women planning pregnancy. Kindara and OvuView (available for Android only) function well for both prevention and planning.
Ultimately, in the absence of scientific literature evaluating or comparing the apps (multi-arm RCT, anyone?), it’s impossible to make a truly evidence-based recommendation. But highlighting the above factors for patients and familiarizing yourself with a few good apps is a safe and appropriate adjunct to self-knowledge and clinical consultation.

Colorado’s Beforeplay.org
It was a pleasure to contribute to Colorado’s fantastic Beforeplay campaign. The Beforeplay team also contributed to Bedsider by helping clean up the Colorado listings in our “Where to get it” database. We love win-wins.
Here’s what the Beforeplay had to say about the collaboration:
Here’s the sitch: Last year, the Colorado statewide effort known as Beforeplay.org made its big debut as a one-touch, online resource for honest, open sexual health information. The goal? To help prevent unintended pregnancies across the state, reduce the spread of STDs and “normalize” the conversation around all things sex.
Thinking, talking and acting is all part of the framework.
From the realities about pregnancy and STDs/STIs to conversations about sexuality and effective birth control, Beforeplay.org is here to encourage Colorado to just talk about it.
At Beforeplay.org we want everyone to make informed, healthy decisions about sex and birth control that are right for them. We are grateful to have been able to source and modify some of Bedsider’s valuable content for the purposes of our own site, including our perpetually convenient health center locator and our interactive birth control method selector. Plus, it goes without saying it has been a great opportunity to have the support of a respected, national resource like Bedsider.
With Bedsider’s help, Beforeplay.org is now a key resource for people to get educated and get talking about sexual health in every corner of Colorado (and since we’re a rectangle state, we really mean every corner). In a way that works for Colorado, people’s knowledge is growing, we’re hitting the streets, nurturing a growing community on Facebook, and blogging up a storm, and people are taking notice…everywhere. Thanks for the hand, Bedsider.
Beforeplay.org’s implant details page pulls method information from Bedsider’s RSS feed and presents it with Beforeplay’s branding.

Here are the topics we've tackled so far:
Nobody’s perfect: Pill efficacy for the real world - Our patients shouldn’t have to be perfect to protect themselves from accidental pregnancy.
Excellent care for LGBTQ patients - Here's how to be part of the solution when it comes to the health disparities LGBTQ people face.
What does the evidence say about combined vs. progestin-only pills? - COCs or POPs? Here are some things to consider when helping a patient pick a pill.
Changing the conversation about contraception - The most useful tool for providing contraceptive care may be to ask the right questions.
Pulling out all the stops: Doubling up with withdrawal - Withdrawal is often ignored by health care providers and researchers, but the best studies we have suggest the majority of people in the U.S. have used it at least once in their lives.
Who is at increased risk of IUD expulsion? - New research holds some surprises about who’s at highest risk of expelling an IUD.
Birth Control Without Barriers - Providers play an important role in empowering women to choose the contraceptive best for them.
What do YOU use for birth control? - The pros, cons, and alternatives when it comes to telling your patients about your own birth control method.
Talking fertility awareness methods with your patients - You may have your doubts about FAM, but what if your patients want to use it?
Misinformed: What do pharmacy staff say about emergency contraception? - Do you know what info your patients get from pharmacists when they ask about EC?
Sex, Gender, and Orientation 101 - When it comes to human sexuality, words are an important tool that we as providers can use to better understand our patients.
Deciding on emergency contraception - How can health care providers help patients make the best decision they can for their emergency contraception?
No more fainting in your practice - It happens all the time, just as you are preparing to place an IUD, your patient faints. The good news is that if you are alert to the signs of an impending vagal, you can almost always prevent loss of consciousness.
Contraception as empowerment - Change the birth control conversation from reactive to proactive.
Birth control when you're living with HIV/AIDS - The 1.1 million people in the U.S. living with HIV or AIDS may have heard that their choices of birth control are limited. The good news is that many methods—including some of the most effective ones—should still work well for them. So let's talk details.
Open enrollment is over: Can you still get covered? - Your patients may not know that certain life changes mean they’re eligible to get health insurance (including coverage of their birth control with no out-of-pocket costs!) before open enrollment starts again. Read on to find out more about the options.
Is birth control info missing from chronic condition care? - Women with chronic health conditions have more medical visits—but are they getting the birth control info they need?
Got a health condition? Know your birth control options! - Period problems, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer... There’s a method that can work for your patient. Read on for more details.
IUDs, STIs, and PID: What's the deal? - Some health care providers refuse to give young women or women without children an IUD for fear of STIs and PID. Science tells us that this is just plain wrong: women can safely use an IUD regardless of age or how many babies they’ve had.
Hello, Skyla! Getting to know the newest IUD - Birth control has many wonderful qualities—but being one-size-fits-all isn’t one of them. So when a new birth control option becomes available—especially one that's long-acting and super-effective—it's kind of a big deal.
Abuse by birth control sabotage - About twelve years ago, I was working as a doctor in a clinic in California. A young woman came in and requested a pregnancy test. Her test was negative. I asked her if she wanted to be pregnant: “No.” Was she using birth control? “No.”
Earth Day Reminder: Birth Control is Green! - We applaud anyone who wants to keep the environment in mind while choosing a birth control method. But before your patient discounts all hormonal methods make sure they have the facts: Any birth control is better than no birth control when it comes to helping the planet.
IUDs are OK: The best new birth control has been here all along - The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists—an association whose members make up 90% of doctors specializing in women’s health in the U.S.—just declared IUDs safe for women of all ages.

That includes an early pilot study of women recruited from three Florida clinics and a large-scale online evaluation that has established Bedsider as the first digital intervention in reproductive health in the U.S.—with adults as an audience—that has shown any evidence of behavioral changes that prevent unplanned pregnancy.
We have also moved our research efforts into clinical settings to improve health care at the point of service. Our early clinical research has been conducted through partnerships with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA). Studies carried out by affiliates of these organizations have explored ways that Bedsider can be used to ease clinic flow, enhance efficiency and comprehensiveness of patient education, and help women find the birth control method that best meets their needs. The results from most of these projects are now in and what they've found is promising!
Check back soon to read more about the findings from our various studies. And if you are interested in conducting research of your own using Bedsider, let us know! We want to hear about your results and share them with our other providers.

Not a provider? VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisNobody’s perfect: Pill efficacy for the real worldOur patients shouldn’t have to be perfect to protect themselves from accidental pregnancy.by Colleen Krajewski, MD, MPHpublished 04/02/16It’s no secret that many women’s health care providers use IUDs, likely because they have the highest efficacy and continuation rates.
But the most common method of birth control among our patients remains the pill.
The pill is advertised as having 99% efficacy, but in real life we know that about it’s closer to 90%. That means about one in 10 women will have an unplanned pregnancy while using this method.
How can the advertised number and real life numbers be so different?
And what can we do to help our patients narrow the gap between these numbers?
Advertised numbers = “perfect use”
The advertised figures, also known as “perfect use” numbers, come from clinical trials of the method sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies making the product. The patients in these clinical trials are carefully screened; those with even minor medical problems or who use other medications are excluded.
These patients are highly motivated to avoid pregnancy, are being financially compensated for being in the study, and have frequent contact with study coordinators.
This is why the term “perfect use” really doesn’t tell the whole story.
It implies that it’s possible for a patient to replicate these efficacy rates in real life.
I prefer to use the term “theoretical use.” I tell my patients: “It’s possible in theory for the methods to work that well, but that’s not usually the case.”
Real-life numbers = “typical use”
The real life numbers, also known as “typical use” numbers, come from nationally representative surveys of women in the United States.
These surveys take a sample from the entire country, include a wide variety of women, and answer the question: “What percentage of couples will become pregnant while using these methods over the course of one year?”
This is much more applicable to my patient’s daily lives.
I prefer to use the term “real life” efficacy to describe these numbers.
Why is the theoretical different from real life pill efficacy?
Another way to ask this question is: “Why do women using the pill in the real world have a lower efficacy than those paid to be in research studies?” There are multiple possible answers, and patients have some common misconceptions about this.
Here are some of the reasons that the pill may not work as advertised:
Didn’t start a new pack on time.
Maybe the pharmacy was closed, or she just couldn’t get to the pharmacy, or she forgot to pick up a new script, or her insurance changed, or her refill order expired… You get the idea.
Skipped more than one pill.
Maybe she had something stressful disrupt her daily routine, or didn’t bring the pack while away from home, or she just plain forgot.
Had another health issue that interfered with absorption.
Maybe she had vomiting due to food poisoning or a hangover, or diarrhea from a course of antibiotics.
Took another medication that made the pill less effective.
While this is less common, there are medications that interfere with the pill.
Lost the pill pack.
It could be an accident like putting pills through the wash, or she could have a partner who interferes with her birth control.
Here are some of the misconceptions I hear from patients about why the pill doesn’t work as advertised:
“I took the pill a few hours late.”
While taking the combination pill every day is an important part of its efficacy, being a few hours off schedule does not meaningfully reduce its efficacy.
“I had to take antibiotics that messed with the pill.”
Most antibiotics don’t directly affect the pharmacokinetics of the pill.
The only exception is rifampin, which is rarely used in the U.S.
Because there are various factors affecting women’s ability to attain theoretical efficacy, we can’t predict which will happen to a specific patient.
Narrow the gap
Here are some things you can do to help narrow the gap between theoretical and real world efficacy:
Prescribe more than one month of pills at a time. If you write a prescription for 365 days, your patient can get access to 13 packs at once. Research shows that having a year’s supply substantially increases continuation and reduces unintended pregnancy.
You can also write a 3 month prescription with four refills (Disp #3, Refill #4) which is a total of 15 months of coverage.
Offer advance provision of emergency contraception (EC) and a back-up method like condoms to all your birth control patients.
Talk with patients about the ways that pill formulations may affect efficacy.
Formulations with fewer placebo pills or ones designed for continuous use may improve efficacy.
Make sure patients know about other methods, especially those whose theoretical-use efficacy and real-life efficacy are basically the same, like IUDs and the implant.
Here are some things your patient can do:
Use Bedsider reminders. A patient can download Bedsider's free app to get fun reminders to take the pill each day.
Keep the pill packet someplace where she’ll see it every day. This could be next to a toothbrush, the coffee machine, or next to her wallet or transit pass in her bag.
When trouble strikes, double up with condoms.
We can never predict when food poisoning may hit, or when stress may result in a missed pill—and condoms are an essential back up method for the next seven days.
There are lots of benefits to using the pill, including lighter periods, clearer skin, fewer ovarian cysts, reduced menstrual pain, and a long-lasting reduction in the risk of uterine cancer.
Whatever reason a patient has for using the pill, I like equipping her with multiple tools to help her succeed.

These are brief anecdotes from trans folks describing bad health care interactions that were bumbling at best, discriminatory or hurtful at worst. Stories like these are part of what motivates me to do better as a health care provider.
Why we should care
We’ve known for a long time that lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people have health disparities compared to heterosexual and cis-gendered people. (Don’t know all these terms? Check out this primer.) LGBTQ people in general and trans folks in particular are medically vulnerable, and bad interactions with providers make them less likely to access care, amplifying this vulnerability. Fearing a negative interaction with a provider, having to educate a provider on gender, or having been denied care in the past may understandably make someone postpone getting needed care.
Healthy People 2020 has made proposals to address health disparities for LGBTQ folks.
For health care providers, two of these proposals are of particular interest:
Encourage regular use of care by learning how to appropriately inquire about and be supportive of patients’ gender, sex, and orientation.
Increase culturally competent medical care by ensuring that trainees interact with LGBTQ patients.
Let’s translate these goals into some practical tips for interacting with patients and improving clinic systems.
Interacting with LGBTQ patients
Ask rather than assume.
You may make a mistake when trying to identify someone’s sex, gender, or orientation. The last one is perhaps a feeling providers know – you may be able to recall a time when you made an incorrect assumption. How did you handle that? You may have been taken aback, or felt embarrassed, and (hopefully!) you apologized to your patient when they pointed out your error.
How might you have prevented this oversight? By asking. There are plenty of opportunities to ask. Perhaps your new patient paperwork asks patients to identify all of these things: sex at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation, and preferred pronouns.
(More details on paperwork below.)
If your records don’t have a spot for this information, talk with your colleagues about how to address this.
If you know someone whose clinic is doing a good job of this, ask to see their forms. A good goal is a system to collect this information once and share it with all the people involved in your patients’ care. You shouldn’t be asking at every single visit.
Use the information your patients give you. Don’t collect it if you’re not going to use it! You should be using patients’ preferred names for every encounter, whether you’re inviting someone to an exam room, starting a conversation, or booking a future appointment.
Don't assume sex/gender/identity are clinically relevant.
When your typical cis-gendered patient comes in for cough or flu care, do you ask about their sex or gender?
Nope.
And you shouldn’t ask LGBTQ patients presenting for this type of routine care either.
Trust your patients to tell you if something about their sex/gender/identity is relevant to their current health care needs.
Making your clinic’s systems work for trans patients
What are some ways you can let LGBTQ patients know that you are a welcoming place for them to access health care?
Some things are easy and some things take more time to shift.
Update your new patient forms. Folks who identify as transgender or gender-variant often encounter barriers to care in the most basic place, like your new patient intake forms. Here are some ways to make these types of forms more inclusive:
Name. Many folks, cis and trans, have preferred names that differ from their legal names. Making this distinction on your paperwork can go a long way to making your patients feel more comfortable. Provide spaces for legal name and preferred name. Avoid using “nickname.”
Sex. Provide multiple options: male, female, intersex, and a spot for patients to choose their own term.
Also, make sure the form correctly identifies these terms as sex rather than gender.
Gender. You may also want to include gender as a separate category.
Options here could be cis, trans MTF, trans FTM, agender, genderqueer and a write-in option.
Orientation. Options here could be heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or gay, and a write-in.
Preferred pronouns. Options here could be she/her, he/him, and a write-in to let patients identify any other preferred terms.
Write-in options are key: there are way too many variations to cover them all with check boxes!
Update your electronic health records. This is the holy grail of accurately sharing a patient’s name, sex, gender, orientation, and preferred pronoun information.
Also make sure you can use your EHR to track preventive screenings like Pap tests and breast exams for patients who have the relevant tissue, regardless of their sex/gender labels.
You’ll need to work with your IT team to make these changes, and you may be able to model it on your improved intake forms.
EHR companies are starting to get more of these requests, so they may offer out-of-the-box solutions for your clinic.
Improve your bathroom signage. If your bathrooms are intended for single-occupancy, an easy fix is to switch to gender-neutral signs.
If you have multi-stall bathrooms, check out these creative suggestions.
Learn how to bill health care plans. Sometimes even getting basic or preventive care covered is a hassle for trans patients.
Check with the relevant health plans about how to bill for services when they may or may not agree with a patient’s birth sex listed on the plan.
You should ask patients whether they have any confidentiality concerns regarding their explanation of benefits forms.
If yes, you may be able to code in a way that helps patients maintain confidentiality while getting access to the care they need (e.g. “endocrine disorder NOS” instead of “gender dysphoria”).
Educate your colleagues
People have a lot of questions and misconceptions about these issues, and it may take time and effort to bring about these changes in your clinic or practice.
Here are some steps you can take:
Share toolkits and guidelines for trans health care with your colleagues.
Watch a video about trans health care at your next staff meeting.
Have staff take a webinar to learn from experts on this topic.
Once you have become an amazing LGBTQ provider, you can list your practice at MyTransHealth and RadRemedy.

Not a provider? VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisHello, Bedsider mobile: Birth control info on your phoneTake your birth control experience anywhere you go with Bedsider's mobile features. published 01/21/16By Connor Davies. Originally published on Bedsider.org.
I have a secret. Even though I use the implant as my birth control method, I still get Bedsider’s birth control text message reminders for the pill. And why not? They’re fun, cheeky facts delivered to my phone every day. I personally use the texts to remind me to catch my train home. But did you know that getting cheeky birth control reminders is just one of the many ways you can use Bedsider on your phone? Let me show you how it all works.
You can text to set up a birth control or appointment reminder.
1) Text ‘MYBC’ to Bedsider’s short code, 42411.
2) Bedsider will text back and ask if you want to set up reminders, find clinics, find EC, or learn about birth control.
3) If you select ‘set up a reminder,’ you’ll get a text asking what kind of reminder you want to set up—birth control or appointment.
If you choose birth control, you’ll get another message asking what method you use (the ring, the pill, the patch, or the shot). If you choose appointment, you’ll be asked to send the date of your appointment.
4) Next you’ll answer a few questions about what time you want your reminder. If it’s an appointment reminder, you’ll get to decide how long before your appointment you want to be reminded. (You can get your reminder 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, or 2 days before your appointment.)
5) Check to make sure you get a confirmation text, then wait for your reminder(s).
Q: What if I’m away from my birth control when my reminder arrives?
A: If you’re busy or don’t have your birth control with you when you get your reminder, no problem. Just text back ‘snooze’ and Bedsider will text you back in an hour—or you can text ‘snooze _h’ and they’ll wait the number of hours you specify before the ‘h’ to remind you again. So, for example, if you know you'll be home in 3 hours and want your reminder to come then, you should text ‘snooze 3h.’ Just keep an eye on how late you snooze.
Q: What if I’m not into the cheeky messages?
A: If you want to opt out of the cheeky messages, you can sign up for discreet reminders instead. You’ll have to go to the website to sign up for or change your reminder, and you'll have the option on the last screen of the sign-up process to choose which kind you want. The discreet reminder doesn't mention your method or the phrase ‘birth control,’ in case you prefer to keep your birth control on the DL.
Q: What if I prefer e-mail to text?
A: If you’re more into email you can also sign up for e-mail reminders to take your pill, change your patch or ring, get your shot, or go to an appointment. Like the texts, if you sign up online, you can opt for a discreet e-mail instead of the cheeky message.
Q: What if I forget to refill my birth control?
A: If you have trouble remembering to refill your birth control, Bedsider can help with that too. If you sign up for a birth control reminder through the website, you'll have the option to set a refill reminder.
Bedsider has a birth control information line (and it’s free).
Bedsider wanted to make their birth control info available for folks without an internet connection or a smartphone, so they set up a free, automated phone service. Give it a ring any time, day or night, to learn about some of the most common birth control methods in English or Spanish—the number is (888)321-0383. Of course there’s more detail on Bedsider.org, but the phone service offerings are easy to understand and pretty comprehensive.
You can text to find places to get health care and birth control or emergency contraception (EC).
When you text ‘MYBC’ to 42411, you’ll have the option to find clinics or EC. All you need is your zip code to get nearby clinic locations and contact info texted to you.
And there’s more (especially if you have a smartphone).
Smart phone users can access just about every part of the website on Bedsider's mobile site. You can see information about all the birth control methods, read questions, and use the free birth control finder. You can also watch videos and read Frisky Fridays and other articles on your phone.
If you’re not a smartphone user, you can subscribe to get Frisky Fridays and/or Provider Perspective articles sent to you via text or email. If you choose the text option, Bedsider will send a text message with a teaser and link, but you'll have to go to the website to actually read the article. If you choose email you'll get the article in you inbox.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisWhat does evidence say about combined vs. progestin-only pills?COCs or POPs? Here are some things to consider when helping a patient pick a pill. by Ashley Brant, DO, MPHpublished 02/09/16Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) remain the most common form of birth control in the U.S., but they’re not right for everyone. Some patients may be limited to progestin-only methods because of medical problems, while others may prefer progestin-only methods for their non-contraceptive benefits. By discussing the side effects and benefits of different kinds of pills with your patient, you can help her choose one that fits her life. Let’s take a closer look at the benefits and side effects of COCs and POPs.
Abnormal bleeding patterns
COCs are frequently used to treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, especially when these symptoms are related to endometriosis or fibroids. COC use can lighten periods and improve anemia in patients with heavy periods. COCs can be used continuously by skipping the placebo pills. This means your patient avoids monthly withdrawal bleed but may have a higher chance of experiencing unexpected spotting.
POPs can also be used to treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, but they can cause irregular spotting, amenorrhea, or prolonged bleeding. In fact, abnormal bleeding is the most common reason for POP discontinuation. Abnormal bleeding patterns often improve or resolve after 3 months, so thorough counseling may improve POP acceptability and adherence. If irregular bleeding would bother your patient, POPs may not be the best option.
Weight gain
The research is clear: there is no link between weight gain and either POP or COC use.
Migraines
Patients who have migraines with aura should not take COCs because of a possible increased risk of stroke. For patients who have migraines without aura, COCs are safe but may increase the frequency or severity of menstrual migraines—especially during the placebo pill week. Continuous use of COCs or switching to POPs may decrease the frequency of migraines and other hormone-related headaches.
Acne
COCs have anti-androgen properties and therefore generally improve acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Patients may notice a flare in their acne when they first start taking COCs, but this will usually resolve. POPs may make acne worse.
Libido
Libido is affected by many factors. Both POPs and COCs are associated with hormonal changes that may decrease libido, although some women will have increased libido when they’re not worried about becoming pregnant.
Cancer risk
While it’s not technically a side effect, your patients may have questions about cancer. Use of COCs is associated with a reduced risk of developing endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Although POPs have not been studied as extensively, it appears that they offer some protection against cancers, too. In the past there was concern about an increased risk of breast cancer with COCs, but the newer low-dose pills have not been shown to increase breast cancer risk.
And the rest…
Other COC side effects include breast tenderness, mood changes, nausea, and bloating. Switching to a POP will likely resolve or improve these side effects.
Regardless of which pill your patient chooses, ask if she’d be willing to use it for at least 3 months. Many side effects will resolve or stabilize in this time period. The benefits and side effects of the contraceptive patch and ring are similar to COCs, since both the patch and ring have estrogen plus progestin. With proper counseling, you can help your patient choose a method of birth control that will fit her life and body. Bedsider has tools to help her remember to take the pill each day and request timely refills.

Not a provider? VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisA welcome from Eve Espeyby Eve Espey, MD, MPHpublished 05/23/13Welcome to Bedsider!
As Chair of Bedsider’s Medical Advisory Committee, I’m so pleased to welcome you to Bedsider Providers. For those who don't already know, Bedsider is a birth control support network operated by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Bedsider was designed specifically for 18-29-year-old women as a response to high rates of unplanned pregnancy.*
Bedsider.org aims to make birth control part of a healthy sex life. It presents information about every birth control method using simple language and visuals, as well as interviews with real people who are using each method. Bedsider features myth-busting animated “fact or fiction” videos, articles about birth control and sexual health, and a weekly Frisky Friday newsletter. The website also features a reward system to motivate users to view and share content and become experts in their own sexual health.
Bedsider goes beyond the website to reach its audience through various types of media and on-the-ground outreach. Local and college outreach efforts are expanding from the pilot phase this year and we look forward to seeing these efforts continue to grow
Why a separate website for providers?
Bedsider seeks to make it easier for young people to use birth control consistently and effectively, and I don’t think I need to tell you that health care providers play an invaluable role in achieving that goal. This site is a resource for doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and anyone else who provides health care and sexual health information to young adults.
Since we know you’re busy and contraceptive counseling can be time consuming, our goal with Bedsider Providers is to help you help your patients find the best birth control for their body and lifestyle. This site was designed to give you the tools to do just that. The site is still a work in progress, but initial offerings include:
A “for patients” section, which gives you a “tour” of Bedsider to familiarize you with the resources and services we offer through Bedsider.org so you can easily share them with your patients.
A "for providers" section, where we tell you about Bedsider resources you can use in your practice. The "interactive tools" section will give you step-by-step instructions for setting up birth control and appointment reminders for your patients. The reminders can be customized to include information about your office or clinic. If you want to incorporate some of our birth control methods information or photography into your own website, we're happy to share. Learn how to get your hands on that stuff in the "shareable content" section of the site.
A "features" section, where you can stay up to date on the latest news about Bedsider and topics related to young women’s sexual health. The features section includes “success stories” where you can learn how Bedsider has already been put to use in a variety of clinical settings. In the "provider to provider" section, articles written by your provider peers will keep you informed about the latest developments in birth control and healthcare for young women. Finally, "bedsider research" shares findings from the various studies – conducted both internally and externally – that have evaluated how Bedsider works for both young women and providers.
An "order materials" section, where you can get all of the postcards, catalogs, DVDs, posters, and other Bedsider materials that you need for your clinic.
Bedsider Providers is meant to help you make birth control easier for your patients. So sign up, take it for a spin, let us know if you found it useful, and whether there are areas we can improve upon. You can contact us at providers@bedsider.org if you have feedback or questions!
Yours,

Not a provider? VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisChanging the conversation about contraceptionThe most useful tool for providing contraceptive care may be to ask the right questions.by Helen Bellanca, MD, MPHpublished 10/22/15Miranda was a 27-year-old woman who came into my clinic to get checked for STIs. After addressing her symptoms, I asked her, “So what are you using to prevent a pregnancy?”
“Condoms,” she said. “Every time?” I asked her. “Whenever he remembers,” she replied.
I asked Miranda if she had thought about other methods.
She had tried the pill before, but didn’t like taking hormones. The IUD scared her because she “didn’t want something stuck inside” of her body.
We were at an impasse, and I was feeling frustrated that I couldn’t seem to structure the conversation in a way that would meet her needs.
Shared decision making is quality contraceptive care
Because I want to do better for patients like Miranda, I have started to change the way I approach these conversations. In our efforts to figure out which birth control method will work for women, we sometimes forget to take a step back and ground the conversation in our patients’ feelings and intentions about pregnancy. Shared decision making is a concept that permeates medical care, from deciding about amniocentesis to cancer treatment. Understanding what our patients value helps us guide them to the right care, and that is just as true in contraception.
So now the conversation sounds more like this:
“How would you feel if you were to get pregnant in the near future?”
“Well, my boyfriend wants a baby, but I’m not sure.”
“Tell me about that.”
“I might be getting kicked out of my apartment, and I’m trying to finish a training program so I can get a better job.”
“It sounds like now is not such a good time for a pregnancy.”
“No, I guess not.”
We talk about how her goals for her life can match up with her choice of contraception.
With further discussion, she decides to try an implant.
Talking to women about their pregnancy intentions is an important part of responding to their requests for contraception.
It is easier to get to a decision about the method that is right for them if we understand their level of desire for pregnancy and their concerns about side effects, ability to hide the method, how difficult it is to use, and how much it costs.
All of these are part of high-quality contraceptive counseling detailed in the Quality Family Planning guidance published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (OPA).
Providers should talk to all women about their pregnancy intentions
I think we can go even further.
Screening women for their pregnancy intentions—even when they are not requesting contraception—is a promising prevention strategy.
Reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy is a national public health goal.
Ensuring that women are using contraception that meets their needs should be the aim of every provider who cares for women.
To meet these goals, providers need to be proactive about having the conversation. And not just once—we should routinely check in with women about how their pregnancy intentions are changing and whether their current method lines up with their intentions.
Tools for providers
One tool for pregnancy intention screening is called One Key Question®.
Colleagues and I developed this approach at the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health, and it has garnered a great deal of attention for its ability to change the conversation.
We asked women: “Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?” Based on her answers, we then asked follow up questions leading to either preconception care or contraception.
Another approach promoted by national contraception counseling expert Patty Cason, RN, MS, FNP, has three questions: “Would you like to have any (more) children?
When do you think that might be?
How important is it to you to prevent pregnancy until then?” This approach allows you to assess not only the need for contraception, but also whether she needs a highly effective method or would be fine with a less effective option.
Measuring our successes
Contraception is part of high-quality preventive care for women.
In the future, I hope to see health care systems consider quality metrics that focus on pregnancy intention screening.
When we start treating contraception as a preventive service and screening all women, men, and teens, then we will really change the conversation.

I don’t have insurance to cover a new one, so I guess I’ll just use condoms.”
There’s good news! Your client can keep using the method she loves.
Although the implant is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for only 3 years, there is new evidence suggesting that it’s safe and effective to use for at least 4 years. The same is true for the 52mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD)—it’s FDA-approved to last up to 5 years but safe and effective to use for at least 6.
Why is prolonged use of the implant and LNG-IUD so important?
Despite the promise of the Affordable Care Act, hundreds of thousands of women will continue to have gaps in their health care coverage and limited access to contraceptives including the implant and IUD.
For example, women in states not expanding their Medicaid eligibility criteria may remain uninsured.
Allowing women to use their implant or IUD for an extra year can mean major benefits for individuals and families. It can also mean big-picture societal benefits.
Research around the world has shown that IUDs and implants help reduce unintended pregnancy, abortion, and poor health for mothers and infants. If a woman can use an IUD or implant for longer, it makes the method even more cost-effective and further reduces the economic burden of these public health problems.
What does the evidence say?
I am part of a team of researchers following nearly 300 women who have used their implant or LNG-IUD beyond the FDA-approved durations of 3 and 5 years, respectively. We just published findings showing that:
123 women had used their implant for an additional year, and 34 for an additional 2 years. For these women, there were no pregnancies.
108 women had used their LNG-IUD for an additional year, 20 for an additional 2 years, and 3 for an additional 3 years. For these women, only one woman became pregnant within a few weeks of the IUD expiration.
The contraceptive failure rates for both the implant and LNG-IUD in the year following their expiration are essentially the same as the rates for the current FDA-approved labels. The failure rate of the implant in the fourth year was 0 per 100 women years (95% CI 0 - 1.61). For the LNG-IUD, the failure rate was 0.51 per 100 women years (95% CI 0.01 - 2.82).
How do these methods keep on working?
Our study will not specifically investigate how these methods prevent pregnancy during prolonged use, but we are evaluating the amount of the implant’s active ingredient, etonorgestrel, in the blood of the women using that method. We know that part of the way the implant works is by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg). Previous research suggested that a minimum of 90 picograms of etonorgestrel per milliliter of blood is required to suppress ovulation. At the fourth year, women in our study had median etonorgestrel levels well above that threshold (170 pg/ml), meaning the implant probably just keeps working the same way to prevent pregnancy after the 3-year mark.
What about overweight or obese women? Can they keep using their implant?
We didn’t limit who could participate in our study by body weight. Women had a range of body mass indices, including <25 kg/m2 or “normal weight” (28%), 25-30 kg/m2 or “overweight” (22%), and >30 kg/m2 or “obese” (50%). We compared the levels of etonorgestrel in the blood across these groups of women and found no differences. With no documented pregnancies and reassuring blood levels of etonogestrel in this diverse group of women, we feel it is safe for women of all weights to use their implant for an additional year.

Here are some things to consider when helping a patient pick a pill. by Ashley Brant, DO, MPHpublished 02/09/16Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) remain the most common form of birth control in the U.S., but they’re not right for everyone. Some patients may be limited to progestin-only methods because of medical problems, while others may prefer progestin-only methods for their non-contraceptive benefits. By discussing the side effects and benefits of different kinds of pills with your patient, you can help her choose one that fits her life. Let’s take a closer look at the benefits and side effects of COCs and POPs.
Abnormal bleeding patterns
COCs are frequently used to treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, especially when these symptoms are related to endometriosis or fibroids. COC use can lighten periods and improve anemia in patients with heavy periods. COCs can be used continuously by skipping the placebo pills. This means your patient avoids monthly withdrawal bleed but may have a higher chance of experiencing unexpected spotting.
POPs can also be used to treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, but they can cause irregular spotting, amenorrhea, or prolonged bleeding. In fact, abnormal bleeding is the most common reason for POP discontinuation. Abnormal bleeding patterns often improve or resolve after 3 months, so thorough counseling may improve POP acceptability and adherence. If irregular bleeding would bother your patient, POPs may not be the best option.
Weight gain
The research is clear: there is no link between weight gain and either POP or COC use.
Migraines
Patients who have migraines with aura should not take COCs because of a possible increased risk of stroke. For patients who have migraines without aura, COCs are safe but may increase the frequency or severity of menstrual migraines—especially during the placebo pill week. Continuous use of COCs or switching to POPs may decrease the frequency of migraines and other hormone-related headaches.
Acne
COCs have anti-androgen properties and therefore generally improve acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Patients may notice a flare in their acne when they first start taking COCs, but this will usually resolve. POPs may make acne worse.
Libido
Libido is affected by many factors. Both POPs and COCs are associated with hormonal changes that may decrease libido, although some women will have increased libido when they’re not worried about becoming pregnant.
Cancer risk
While it’s not technically a side effect, your patients may have questions about cancer. Use of COCs is associated with a reduced risk of developing endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Although POPs have not been studied as extensively, it appears that they offer some protection against cancers, too. In the past there was concern about an increased risk of breast cancer with COCs, but the newer low-dose pills have not been shown to increase breast cancer risk.
And the rest…
Other COC side effects include breast tenderness, mood changes, nausea, and bloating. Switching to a POP will likely resolve or improve these side effects.
Regardless of which pill your patient chooses, ask if she’d be willing to use it for at least 3 months. Many side effects will resolve or stabilize in this time period. The benefits and side effects of the contraceptive patch and ring are similar to COCs, since both the patch and ring have estrogen plus progestin. With proper counseling, you can help your patient choose a method of birth control that will fit her life and body. Bedsider has tools to help her remember to take the pill each day and request timely refills.

It still catches me off guard. Should I talk about my ParaGard? Would this be awkward? Coercive? A great chance for connection? Even tougher for me was how to answer during those years when I wasn’t using a contraceptive.
Self-disclosure by providers is a controversial topic in all areas of medicine. In the field of reproductive health, in which it’s common to discuss the most intimate of topics with our patients, self-disclosure is an especially important consideration. Studies by Evans and by Zapata suggest that, when appropriate, provider self-disclosure about contraception can be done without negative consequences. But how can we be certain that a situation is appropriate? And in circumstances when a clinician isn’t using birth control (e.g., she is trying to conceive; she is infertile; or, like me, she has a female partner), how should she handle the situation?
What do the data tell us?
With this question in mind, Planned Parenthood colleagues and I undertook a survey last year to find out what contraceptive methods female family planning providers use. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that they would use IUDs and implants at higher rates than the general population.
This turned out to be true, but the difference was even more dramatic than we guessed. In our study, 40% of the 331 respondents currently using a contraceptive had an IUD and 2% had an implant. By comparison, according to estimates from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) in 2011–2013, 11% of women aged 25–44 were using an IUC and less than 1% were using an implant. Family planning providers were also more likely to report using the vaginal ring and less likely to use female sterilization and condoms compared to women surveyed in the NSFG. Less than 1% of providers were using the patch, the shot, the diaphragm, sponge or spermicides.
Keeping the patient in the center of the conversation
We hope that these findings can be useful in situations when self-disclosure might not feel appropriate, but a provider would like to be able to say something about how providers use contraception overall. Ultimately, each woman is the expert in her own health, preferences, and needs, so these findings—like your own experiences—should be used to stimulate her own reflection and choice.
So next time you get that potentially thorny question—“What do you use for birth control?”—here are some ways you might be able to bring your patient back to her preferences:
“I use a ring, mainly because getting my period at a predictable time is important to me. What’s most important to you in a birth control method?”
“There was actually just a study of about 500 women like me—family planning providers—and it found that the IUD, the pill, the ring, and their partner having a vasectomy were the most popular methods. Have you considered any of those methods?”
We are all patients
Besides contraceptive counseling, I am hopeful that this research can have other benefits for reproductive health practice. After all, we providers are all patients, too—sexual people with our own personal needs and health concerns. Recognizing this and reflecting on our own unique experiences can help build empathy—perhaps the most critical element in high-quality care.
Please comment here or use your own social media to share your experiences with contraceptive decision-making—as a provider, as a user, or both. Also a word of acknowledgement: while this study was focused on female family planning providers, we know that non-female providers may also be asked about their and their partners’ contraceptive experiences. If you have experiences to share, please do so in the comments.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisWho is at increased risk of IUD expulsion?New research holds some surprises about who’s at highest risk of expelling an IUD.by Justin Diedrich, MD, and Tessa Madden, MD, MPHpublished 07/05/15"Reason for visit: Possible expulsion." When we hear this, we always hope our patient is mistaken.
An expulsion is when an intrauterine device (IUD) comes out of the uterus on its own and it happens for about 1 in 20 IUD users. Expulsion leaves the patient vulnerable to unintended pregnancy. A recent study by Madden and colleagues examined this phenomenon and the risk factors associated with it.
What causes an expulsion?
One thought is that expulsions are due to a small uterus—for example, when the patient is young or has not yet had a baby. Biologically, this makes sense. If we try to place an IUD inside a uterus that is barely larger than the device, wouldn't there be a higher chance the uterus will expel it? Despite the importance of this question, it has been hard to answer.
Studying expulsion
The new study focused on IUD users participating in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. The CHOICE Project was a study of over 9,000 women who received contraceptive counseling, were given the method of their choice at no cost, then were followed for up to 3 years afterwards. For this analysis, every participant with a suspected expulsion had her chart reviewed by two of the investigators.
Among the 5,053 women who received an IUD, there were 432 expulsions. This amounts to 6.2 expulsions per 100 IUD users over the course of a year. This is around what we would expect based on previous research.
What did the study find?
The great thing about this study is that it had enough women using IUDs to look at smaller groups of women.
This let us explore whether age, parity, or other characteristics of our patients were related to expulsion. The study found that:
Women under age 20 had a higher rate of expulsion (10.5/100 women per year).
Among women over age 20, those who were nulliparous had a lower expulsion rate compared to those who had one or more children (3.2 versus 7.2/100, respectively).
Nulliparous women using the levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena™) had lower expulsion than parous women (3.8 versus 7.9/100).
Nulliparous women using the copper IUD (ParaGard™) had slightly more expulsions than parous women, although this finding was not statistically significant (6.0 versus
5.5/100).
Women with self-reported heavier periods at baseline had a higher rate of expulsion overall (8.8/100).
In a model controlling for women’s characteristics, only being under age 20 and heavy periods were associated with increased risk of expulsion for both types of IUD.
That teens have a higher expulsion rate is not news. But the observation that parity was not associated with expulsion is. With the ACOG recommendation to offer IUDs to women as a first line option, this finding could help allay concerns about providing IUDs to nulliparous women. It’s also important to keep these findings in context. Expulsions happen, but they occur in a minority of patients.
What does this mean for practice?
The largest implication of this study is that parity was not associated with IUD expulsion. Women who are younger and those with heavy menses at baseline are at a higher risk of expulsion, but the IUD should remain among the contraceptive options they consider. All women deserve access to the most effective methods of contraception—regardless of their age, menses, or whether or not they have had children yet.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisChanging the conversation about contraceptionThe most useful tool for providing contraceptive care may be to ask the right questions.by Helen Bellanca, MD, MPHpublished 10/22/15Miranda was a 27-year-old woman who came into my clinic to get checked for STIs. After addressing her symptoms, I asked her, “So what are you using to prevent a pregnancy?”
“Condoms,” she said. “Every time?” I asked her. “Whenever he remembers,” she replied.
I asked Miranda if she had thought about other methods.
She had tried the pill before, but didn’t like taking hormones. The IUD scared her because she “didn’t want something stuck inside” of her body.
We were at an impasse, and I was feeling frustrated that I couldn’t seem to structure the conversation in a way that would meet her needs.
Shared decision making is quality contraceptive care
Because I want to do better for patients like Miranda, I have started to change the way I approach these conversations. In our efforts to figure out which birth control method will work for women, we sometimes forget to take a step back and ground the conversation in our patients’ feelings and intentions about pregnancy. Shared decision making is a concept that permeates medical care, from deciding about amniocentesis to cancer treatment. Understanding what our patients value helps us guide them to the right care, and that is just as true in contraception.
So now the conversation sounds more like this:
“How would you feel if you were to get pregnant in the near future?”
“Well, my boyfriend wants a baby, but I’m not sure.”
“Tell me about that.”
“I might be getting kicked out of my apartment, and I’m trying to finish a training program so I can get a better job.”
“It sounds like now is not such a good time for a pregnancy.”
“No, I guess not.”
We talk about how her goals for her life can match up with her choice of contraception.
With further discussion, she decides to try an implant.
Talking to women about their pregnancy intentions is an important part of responding to their requests for contraception.
It is easier to get to a decision about the method that is right for them if we understand their level of desire for pregnancy and their concerns about side effects, ability to hide the method, how difficult it is to use, and how much it costs.
All of these are part of high-quality contraceptive counseling detailed in the Quality Family Planning guidance published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (OPA).
Providers should talk to all women about their pregnancy intentions
I think we can go even further.
Screening women for their pregnancy intentions—even when they are not requesting contraception—is a promising prevention strategy.
Reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy is a national public health goal.
Ensuring that women are using contraception that meets their needs should be the aim of every provider who cares for women.
To meet these goals, providers need to be proactive about having the conversation. And not just once—we should routinely check in with women about how their pregnancy intentions are changing and whether their current method lines up with their intentions.
Tools for providers
One tool for pregnancy intention screening is called One Key Question®.
Colleagues and I developed this approach at the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health, and it has garnered a great deal of attention for its ability to change the conversation.
We asked women: “Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?” Based on her answers, we then asked follow up questions leading to either preconception care or contraception.
Another approach promoted by national contraception counseling expert Patty Cason, RN, MS, FNP, has three questions: “Would you like to have any (more) children?
When do you think that might be?
How important is it to you to prevent pregnancy until then?” This approach allows you to assess not only the need for contraception, but also whether she needs a highly effective method or would be fine with a less effective option.
Measuring our successes
Contraception is part of high-quality preventive care for women.
In the future, I hope to see health care systems consider quality metrics that focus on pregnancy intention screening.
When we start treating contraception as a preventive service and screening all women, men, and teens, then we will really change the conversation.

Westhoff, MD and Cynthia C. Harper, PhDpublished 07/01/15In 1961, Estelle Griswold, then the executive director of Planned Parenthood in Connecticut, and medical director C. Lee Buxton, chair of the Yale University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, opened a birth control clinic in New Haven. They were arrested for violating a Connecticut law that prohibited birth control.
Four years later—fifty years ago—their case made it to the Supreme Court. Griswold v. Connecticut was a landmark decision providing the first constitutional protection for birth control. But evidence shows that just because birth control is legal and constitutionally protected doesn’t mean it is accessible. Today, more than 99 percent of American women of reproductive age who have had intercourse have used birth control at some point in their lives—but very often they are unable to get access to the method best for them.
For many, cost is a gatekeeper. Birth control is expensive, even though it is basic health care. Over half of women 18 to 34 report having struggled with the cost at some point in their lives and as a result have used it inconsistently. The cost of the pill typically ranges from $15 to $50 a month—up to $600 per year. The up-front cost for the IUD ranges from $500 to $1,000.
To address the cost barrier, state and federal governments have partnered on programs to get birth control to low-income women in need, and to ensure full coverage all birth control methods as part of the Affordable Care Act.
A body of evidence shows that when the cost barrier is lifted, the most effective birth control methods are used more widely, leading to a reduction of unintended pregnancies and contributing to a continuation in the decline of the U.S. abortion rate, which has reached its lowest level since Roe v. Wade.
But even when a woman’s copay is $0, she still may not end up with the right method for her needs, which can change over the course of a woman’s life. This is because some providers themselves may lack the training to counsel a woman fully on all her birth control options, their risks and benefits. Or providers may be unfamiliar in inserting newer and more effective methods, such as IUDs and implants.
We wanted to better understand how we could reduce any barriers women’s health providers may be inadvertently putting between a woman and her preferred method of birth control, so researchers at the University of California, San Francisco teamed up with researchers at Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood health centers across the U.S. to create the first clinic-based intervention in a randomized trial to reduce unintended pregnancies. Our results have just been published in The Lancet.
We discovered that training health care providers in contraceptive counseling and insertion of the most effective forms of contraception could affect patients’ contraceptive decisions and pregnancy rates. When women receive full information about available birth control methods, and their health care professionals are trained to offer IUDs and implants, many women choose these methods, which are the most effective reversible forms of contraception approved by the FDA. The training resulted in a striking reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies among family planning clients—from 15 to 8 per 100 women over a year. However, in the abortion care setting, where cost restrictions on contraceptives are high, only 44 percent of women who chose IUDs or implants were able to actually obtain them, and pregnancy rates were not reduced for these women.
IUDs and implants are excellent birth control options for many women because they have extremely low failure rates: less than one percent. Many women like not having to remember to take a pill every day or switch out a ring every month. Once an IUD or implant is inserted, a woman can pretty much forget about it. But IUDs and implants may not be the right method for every woman, and that is a decision that belongs to the patient in consultation with her skilled women’s health care provider.
As our research shows, providers play an important role in empowering women to choose the contraceptive best for them. Providing this kind of expert contraceptive counseling is not just the right thing to do; it’s the smart thing to do, since it significantly reduces unintended pregnancy.

Gender: Trans (FTM). Orientation: Gay.
Preferred pronoun: they/them. Parity: G1P1.
Any confusion? For folks who have never questioned their sex, gender, orientation, or preferred pronoun, it may be a challenge to keep up with patients who have spent years thinking about these questions themselves. But when it comes to human sexuality, words are an important tool that we as providers can use to better understand our patients. Let’s start by breaking down the differences between a few terms that may be easily conflated: sex, gender, and orientation. While we are at it, let’s talk about the pronouns your patients may use besides she and he.
Sex
This is biology: “sex” refers to the organs, hormones, and secondary sex characteristics that are considered male or female. This is usually assigned at birth, when the provider attending the birth announces whether the genitalia are those of a boy or a girl (though those terms actually describe gender, not sex). If we were being more accurate, babies would be proclaimed male or female at birth.
The majority of the time, these biological factors align with the sex label given at birth, meaning the internal and external genitalia match one another, and the gonads produce the sex hormones that one would expect given those genitalia.
Males have testes that produce testosterone and a penis. Let’s not attach the word “man” to this description. Let’s accurately describe this as male anatomy.
Females have ovaries that produce estrogen, a vagina, and a uterus. As above, let’s avoid the word "woman" when describing anatomy. This is female anatomy.
Intersex people may experience an incorrect proclamation of their sex at birth. There is biological variation in the production of hormones, the forming of sex organs, and the interaction of genetics that may make one not absolutely male or female. Relatively common chromosomal anomalies, like Turner or Klinefelter syndrome, can result in being intersex. Gonadal or genital anatomy can be different, such as in Mullerian agenesis, or ovotestes, or Swyer syndrome. One’s body may not respond to the hormones that are produced by the gonads, as in androgen insensitivity syndrome. There are many such conditions that would make someone somewhere between male and female. We can consider sex to be a spectrum with male at one end, female at the other, and intersex every step between.
Gender
If sex is the hardware of the body, then gender is the software. This is how a person identifies, or feels, in terms of man, woman, trans, or none of the above. People’s gender identity may match their biological sex or not.
When someone uses the words “man” or “boy” to identify himself, he is stating that his gender is male. He may also have the biologic aspects of a male—or he may not. When someone uses the words “woman” or “girl” to identify herself, she is stating that her gender is female. She may also have the biologic aspects of a female–or she may not.
The terms cisgender or cis come from the Latin meaning “on the same side.” When people’s sex (biology) matches their gender (identity), then they are cis. For example, having a body with male genitalia that produces testosterone and calling oneself a man.
The terms transgender or trans come from the Latin meaning “across.” When people’s sex does not match their gender, they may identify as trans. One may have been born male and now identify as a woman, which can also be known as MTF (male to female) or trans woman. One may have been born female and currently identify as a man, trans man, or FTM (female to male). And yes, the trans acronyms use sex words rather than gender words, just to keep you on your toes.
Some patients may identify as genderqueer. This term means any gender identity that does not fit into the man-woman binary. Just like sex, gender is also a spectrum. If man is one end of our gender spectrum and woman is another, genderqueer is the area in between. Some folks consider themselves gender fluid – moving along this spectrum. Others may decline masculine or feminine, and instead identify as a unique gender or genderless.
Many cultures have gender concepts that eschew the binary man-woman model. For example, some Native Americans use the term two-spirit to describe community members who do not fit into a man’s or woman’s gender roles.
Orientation
Now we are describing someone’s attraction set. One may be attracted to people of the opposite sex or gender, or perhaps the same sex or gender, or maybe one has a very wide attraction set that goes beyond binary. As yet another alternative, maybe one’s attraction set is…nobody.
An orientation of straight or heterosexual means one is attracted to members of the opposite sex and/or gender. Bisexuals are attracted to both their own and the opposite sex and/or gender. Gay, lesbian, homosexual, and same-gender-loving are all terms describing people attracted to their same sex and/or gender. Those who identify as queer have a variety of attraction sets; the main point is that they reject traditional gender identities. Pansexuals’ attraction set is formed without taking into account sex or gender. Asexuals are not sexually attracted to others.
Pronouns
Many languages use gendered pronouns. Pronouns are often assigned to folks based on whether they are presumed to be a man or a woman. It’s easy to get this wrong when you’re working with patients with non-binary sex and gender identities.
He/his is often preferred by those who identify as men, and she/her is often preferred by those who identify as women.
Grammar sticklers, stay with me on this one: you may hear they/their/them used as singular pronouns. Some people may choose this gender-neutral pronoun to reflect their sex or gender, or as a personal preference. Here’s an example: Jay, a genderqueer individual, prefers they/their them. When talking about Jay, I may say “Jay went shopping. They bought some new shoes. Their shoes are a little loud for my tastes, but look great on them.”
Other gender-neutral pronouns are more creative: ze (or zie), hir/hirself, ya/yum, thon/thons/thonself. It/its is another gender-neutral choice, although less popular than they or zie.
How do these fit together?
Each of your patients has a unique relationship to sex, gender, and orientation. Given that their location on these spectra directly affects their sexual and reproductive health, it’s a good practice to get comfortable asking them about it.

The U.S.’s top public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), doesn’t even include withdrawal on its list of contraceptive methods.
When researchers ask people about the birth control they use, they sometimes don’t ask about withdrawal.
But the best studies we have suggest the majority of people in the U.S. have used it at least once in their lives.
We also know that withdrawal has a long history. In fact, before modern birth control existed, it was a critical way for people all over the world to limit the size of their families. So what do we really know about who uses withdrawal and how? Let’s talk details.
How many people use withdrawal?
One recent article proclaimed that today’s 30-somethings are “the pull-out generation,”, but research suggests that very few couples in the U.S. use withdrawal as their only method of birth control. The proportion of people using this method alone has either remained steady or declined over the last 20 years. Today, only about 3% of U.S. women say they rely on withdrawal alone.
But that doesn’t tell you much about how people use it, or how they combine it with other methods.
Pulling out all the stops
Two recent studies showed that lots of people use withdrawal, and that they often use it in combination with another method of birth control.
In a large study of U.S. women, about 1 in 3 (33%) had used withdrawal at least once in the last month, but less half of them (14%) reported that withdrawal was the most effective form of birth control they used. Sounds like a big difference from the 3% who said they rely on withdrawal in the CDC survey, right? For this study, the researchers asked about withdrawal separately from other methods, which they think led more people to report it.
Many people don’t think of withdrawal as an official method of birth control, so they might not select it from a longer list of methods.
In a national study that asked young people about the last time they had penis-vagina sex, 14% of women and 17% of men reported using withdrawal. But only 7% and 6%, respectively, reported withdrawal as their only method. In this study, people chose their method(s) from a long list, so they might have reported using withdrawal less often than if they had been asked about it directly in a separate question.
In both studies, the methods people reported using along with withdrawal were most often the pill or condoms.
Some people said they used withdrawal along with an extremely effective method like the IUD.
The bottom line: most folks who use withdrawal are doubling it up, sometimes using it at the same time as another method and sometimes switching between withdrawal and another method.
Withdrawal-plus benefits
These studies both showed that some folks are using withdrawal to double or even triple-up on birth control—pulling out all the stops, as it were. Let’s call this idea “withdrawal-plus.”
And let’s take a moment to point out that withdrawal-plus busts the myth that people who use withdrawal are lazy or clueless.
Adding withdrawal to your birth control mix has some interesting potential benefits.
It may help both people in a couple play a role in pregnancy prevention—as in, “you take the pill, I’ll pull out.” For folks who feel that condoms reduce sexual pleasure—and who know they’re both in the clear on STIs—using withdrawal-plus may offer a more pleasurable alternative . It can also help guys get more in tune with their bodies, since withdrawal requires that you know when you’re about to ejaculate.
Withdrawal-only benefits
There are some cases when using withdrawal by itself may be a good option.
If a couple prefers to avoid pregnancy but doesn’t have any other birth control available, withdrawal can be their best friend—it’s free, can be used spontaneously any time, and is much more effective than using nothing.
For couples who’ve thought and talked about their desires and plans for family and agreed they’re open to the idea of a pregnancy, using withdrawal as their only method may be appealing.
That way, they can let a pregnancy happen rather than deliberately try to conceive. In fact, in both the studies I described above, people who were on the fence about pregnancy were more likely to have used withdrawal recently, either by itself or with another method.
So however you may choose to use withdrawal, enjoy!

They could make you eligible to get health insurance coverage.published 07/14/14By Lauren Birchfield Kennedy of the National Partnership for Women & Families.
Certain life changes might mean you’re eligible to get health insurance (including coverage of your birth control with no out-of-pocket costs!) through the Health Insurance Marketplace outside of the open enrollment periods. Read on to find out more about your options.
Could you be eligible for special enrollment in a marketplace plan?
The next open enrollment period to get private health insurance in the ACA marketplace begins October 15, 2015. You can only sign up for a marketplace plan during an open enrollment period, unless you experience a “qualifying life event.”
What’s a qualifying life event?
Qualifying life events trigger special enrollment periods that allow you to sign up for private health insurance in the marketplace outside of open enrollment. Qualifying life events include getting married, having a baby, moving to another state, losing job-based coverage, and other major life changes.
For example, if you change jobs and your new employer doesn’t offer health coverage, you’ll be eligible for a special enrollment period and can sign up for a health plan in the marketplace.
You experienced a qualifying life event—now what?
If you experience a qualifying life event, you can apply for insurance through Healthcare.gov or your state’s marketplace to find out if you qualify for a special enrollment period.
Could you be eligible to enroll in Medicaid?
Medicaid, the government-sponsored health insurance program for low-income individuals and families, accepts new enrollees year-round. Eligibility for Medicaid coverage depends on your income and household size. In states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, young women without children who are paid less than $15,856 per year are eligible for Medicaid. (Unfortunately, many states have chosen not to expand their Medicaid programs. See if your state is one of them.)
If you think you may be eligible for Medicaid coverage, you can learn more at healthcare.gov.
One last thing…
If you enroll in a health plan through the marketplace, be sure to stay on top of reporting changes in your income or family size to the marketplace, since those changes may affect your eligibility for Medicaid, premium tax credits, or cost-sharing subsidies. Reporting changes to the marketplace when they happen will ensure you receive the right financial help and avoid surprises at tax time!

"I'll take whatever they have at the pharmacy."
"Is there a difference?"
I bet you’ve heard similar responses when talking to your patients about emergency contraception (EC). How can we to address these responses? How do we help our patients make the best decision they can for their emergency contraception?
What works best?
First off, the most effective EC for anyone is the copper intrauterine device (IUD). A systematic review of 35 years of data from using the copper IUD as EC showed a failure rate of less than one per 1,000. The copper IUD also has no loss of efficacy with an increase in body mass index (BMI), so it is a particularly good choice for obese women presenting after unprotected sex. It also remains highly effective when inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse (UPI ), unlike EC pills. Finally, the copper IUD has the added benefit of providing long-term contraception.
What do we know about weight and EC pills?
The concern about the efficacy of hormonal EC and weight stems from a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of two kinds of EC pills: levonorgestrel (LNG, like Plan B One-step, Next Choice, and other generics) versus ulipristal acetate (UPA, like ella).
Among LNG pill users, the study found that the risk of pregnancy was more than four-fold greater for obese women compared with women with normal BMI. In fact, levonorgestrel showed such a rapid decrease of efficacy with increasing BMI that for women with BMI at 26 or higher there was no effect on pregnancy prevention.
Among UPA pill users, the risk of pregnancy was two and a half-fold greater for obese women compared to women with normal BMI. For UPA, there was no effect on pregnancy prevention at BMI of 35 or greater.
This study also conducted analyses using weight rather than BMI, and those analyses came to a similar conclusion—higher weight meant less effective EC pills.
These data led the makers of an LNG pill in Europe known as NorLevo to change their label. It now warns: “In clinical trials, contraceptive efficacy was reduced in women weighing 75 kg (165 lbs) or more, and levonorgestrel was not effective in women who weighed more than 80 kg (176 lbs).” Thus far, neither the manufacturers nor the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have made changes to the labels for EC pills sold in the U.S. However, more research on this topic is forthcoming and if the new studies confirm these findings, label changes may be just a matter of time.
What does this mean for your patients?
Given these new data on the relative efficacy of different types of EC, clinicians should consider starting EC counseling with the copper IUD. If you’re already using tiers of effectiveness for contraceptive counseling, you can apply the same approach to EC. Here are patient education charts showing EC options in order of their effectiveness.
If your practice is not already offering IUD insertion at a patient’s first visit, you may have some challenges to offering the copper IUD for EC. For example, you need to have the devices in stock, have providers on staff who are comfortable with the insertion procedure, and have time in your schedule for the slightly longer appointment. Clinics around the U.S. have committed to offering the copper IUD for EC as part of a special project of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association. These clinics are working through these types of challenges, and they’ll be sharing what they learn in the coming months.
For women who can’t use the copper IUD or choose not to, you can help them choose between LNG and UPA based on their BMI, time since UPI, and access. Women with BMI >=26 or more than 3 days elapsed since UPI should be counseled to take UPA since it does not decrease in efficacy for up to 5 days. LNG should be reserved for women with normal BMIs who are able to take EC soon after UPI, and for those for whom access to UPA is not feasible. Overall, these new data about EC are good news. They allow us to give our patients more accurate information about their options and encourage us as providers to expand our services to meet our patients’ needs. Stay tuned for more information on EC effectiveness in the coming months!

I don't need birth control." I hear this from many of my heterosexual patients, particularly younger ones. Or more pointedly, "Well, I'm never having sex again." Famous last words.
In these types of situations, I used to think, If she changes her mind, hopefully she'll come back to see me. Framed this way, contraception is reactive: if you're not currently having sex, why worry about contraception? Instead, I've started reframing contraception in terms of empowerment.
Contraception is power
Using contraception should not be reactionary. It should have nothing to do with this guy or even this relationship. I hope that my patients do not get pregnant until they are ready. Instead of the default position being I will get pregnant unless I do something to prevent it, I want my patients to be able to say "I won't get pregnant until I am ready to get pregnant." This is the power of contraception used consistently and correctly. Particularly powerful contraceptives are the [long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods IUDs and the implant. LARC methods can help empower patients by removing common barriers to consistent use of other methods: patients don't have to remember whether they took the pill today or yesterday, when they need a refill, when the next shot is due, or when to swap the next patch or ring.
Contraception is about her, not him
When I talk to my patients, I ask them if they’re sexually active with men, women or both. For those who are at risk of pregnancy, I bring up IUDs and the implant. (Oftentimes I bring up these methods to patients who are not at risk of pregnancy, but thats a different conversation.)
Male partners can contribute to contraception in a number of different ways:
He can wear condoms;
He can help cover the costs of contraception, which remain patchy despite the ACA requirement for birth control coverage without out-of-pocket costs;
He can educate himself about contraceptives and support his partner in using her method of choice.
But ultimately, contraception is the woman’s choice, and she can use a method without telling anyone else about it.
Resolving contraceptive ambivalence
Sometimes patients aren’t ready to commit to contraception. In that case, I use reproductive life planning questions and techniques from motivational interviewing. I ask, “How would you feel if you became pregnant?” This usually leads to some follow-up questions, especially when a patient reacts with dread. I try to show that the default can be automatic protection against pregnancy rather than: “If I decide to have sex, we can use condoms… Or maybe I’ll come back to the GYN and get something.” Sometimes it’s a revelation for a patient that she can be in control of her fertility.
Side effects or fringe benefits?
Most long-acting reversible methods are hormone-based. The levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena) has the effect of decreasing cramping and bleeding significantly. One in five women are amenorrheic at one year, and half don’t have any bleeding by year five. The implant has some irregular bleeding the first three months, but this largely goes away, and 10-20% of women will be amenorrheic with this method, too. Some patients love amenorrhea, especially when they have heavy or painful periods. For them, these “side effects” are actually benefits.
But can my patients afford it?
One of the biggest obstacles to contraception, especially the LARC methods, is their potentially high up-front cost. For a patient without health insurance, the IUD or subdermal implant can cost up to $1,200. The ACA requires that all new private health insurance plans cover contraception without out-of-pocket costs for patients. Most Medicaid programs cover LARC insertion and removal, and some academic medicine centers are able to provide free devices. It’s an injustice that a patient cannot get the contraceptive method she wants because of cost. If you have a patient who is having trouble getting her method covered, she can contact the National Women’s Law Center for help by calling 1-866-745-5487 or emailing coverher@nwlc.org.
Contraception makes her strong, responsible
Because in the end, as I like to tell my patients, “You don't do it for him, you do it for you.”

All of us who have been involved with patient care for any length of time know how scary, disruptive, and unpleasant for a patient a vasovagal reaction can be. The good news is that if you are alert to the signs of an impending vagal, you can almost always prevent loss of consciousness.
Once you are a pro at recognizing these signs, you can use these simple tips so you'll (almost) never have to manage vasovagal fainting in your practice again. In the 10 years I've used these tips, I've had only one patient who fainted.
The basics: Pathophysiology of a vasovagal reaction
A vagal begins with excessive pooling of blood in the arms and legs. This causes a sudden drop in the return of blood from peripheral veins, triggering a cardiac “hypercontractile” state—i.e. the heart beats faster. Paradoxically, this provokes both a reflex bradycardia—an abnormally slow heart beat—and a drop in peripheral vascular resistance, meaning the body suddenly needs less energy to push blood through blood vessels. Together, these reactions lead to reduced brain perfusion, and too little blood in the brain can cause fainting.
1. Know the common triggers
There are some common events in patient care that can trigger vasovagal reactions:
Invasive procedures like cervical or uterine biopsies or placement of an IUD
Pap tests
Blood draws
“Fainting at the sight of blood”
Injections
Watching a loved one have a procedure
2. Be alert for pre-syncopal signs or symptoms
Maintain communication with your patient during these types of procedures. This will help you to notice the signs, and allow the patient to let you know about an early warning symptom.
Here are signs you may see:
Diaphoresis (sweating)
Facial pallor (pale or green/grey)
Dilated pupils
Yawning
Fatigue, restlessness
Here are signs your patient may tell you about:
Lightheadedness, dizziness
Nausea
Ringing in the ears
Blurred or reduced vision (spots, dark, grey tone, or tunnel-vision)
Sudden sensation of feeling hot or cold
Sudden feeling of need to urinate or defecate
Headache
3. Stop the vasovagal reaction
As soon as you see one of these symptoms, pause what you are doing and instruct the patient to contract the muscles in her arms and legs isometrically. That’s it—her symptoms will usually stop immediately.
Here are the details for talking patients through this process:
I instruct a patient to intensely grip her arm, hand, leg, and foot muscles. I have her keep her abdominal muscles relaxed. There is no need to bring the legs together; no need to change position—just have her strongly tense the muscles.
You can demonstrate for her which muscles to tense by touching her lower leg, foot, knee, lower thigh, hand, and arm.
You can say: “Tense up your muscles here, all of the muscles in your hands and arms and feet and legs—you don’t need to move them at all—just grip your muscles really strongly. Now hold it… hold it.”
You can advise the patient to hold the contraction until you think she may be getting tired, then have her take a break for a moment. “And now grip your muscles again, really tight!” You can continue to do this for as long as it is necessary, but often only once or twice is sufficient.
Why does this prevent a vasovagal reaction? Since the first event that occurs with a vagal response is pooling of blood in the arms and legs, it turns out that if the person contracts the muscles in the extremities, the blood is pushed back into the center of the body. This halts the vasovagal and prevents loss of consciousness.
Is your patient a fainter?
Vasovagal reactions (a.k.a. neurocardiogenic syncope) occur more frequently in people who have a predisposition, so ask your patients if they have ever fainted at the sight of blood or lost consciousness when having an injection or procedure. If yes, prior to a procedure:
Be sure your patient is well hydrated.
Be sure your patient has eaten.
Teach your patient how to stop the reflex if s/he starts to feel early warning symptoms.
Another trick is to recommend that patients cross their legs before a blood draw or an injection.

VisitBedsider.org »Welcome!Join Bedsider ProvidersToggle navigationupdatesdigital toolsfrequently asked questionsorder materialsSHOPTALK /share thisBirth control and chronic condition careChronic health conditions require more medical visits. Are women getting the info they need?published 04/15/15There are a bunch of common health conditions—like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, and obesity—that affect U.S. women under age 45. Women who have chronic health conditions like these are more likely to visit a health care provider regularly than those who don't, yet they may also be more likely to have accidental pregnancies. Could it be that despite the frequent medical visits, these women aren't getting the information they need about birth control?
Researchers from the University of Michigan and Yale University tried to answer that question by looking at insurance claims from over 11,600 women ages 21-45 who were covered by private insurance plans in Michigan. The researchers only looked at women who had been covered for three or more years by health plans that covered birth control.
Bad news for women with health conditions?
Taking into account the women's age, income, number of medical visits, and frequency of Pap tests, the study found that women with chronic health conditions were 15% less likely to have prescriptions for birth control compared to women who didn't have a health condition. This suggests that the people who provide primary health care for the nearly 40 million women living with chronic conditions may not be doing enough to inform these women about their birth control options. It's bad news for any woman living with a chronic health condition who doesn't want to be pregnant, and even worse news for those whose conditions make pregnancy especially risky.
Something to keep in mind...
Because this study used health insurance claims, the researchers could only learn about women's use of prescription birth control methods like the pill, the patch, the ring, the shot, IUDs, and the implant. They couldn't learn about women's use of condoms, withdrawal, or fertility awareness methods (a.k.a. Natural Family Planning), so they may have underestimated total birth control use. (Unfortunately we don't know if women with chronic health conditions are any more likely than women without health conditions to use non-prescription birth control methods.)
If you have a chronic health condition, this study suggests you may want to take the lead on asking your health care provider about your birth control options. If you're dealing with heavy or irregular periods, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer, we can help you start exploring your options too.

Know your birth control options!Period problems, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer... There’s a method that can work for you.by Nerys Benfield, MDpublished 07/11/13There is an effective birth control option for everyone—including those with health conditions like heavy or irregular periods, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer. Some methods can actually help treat certain conditions. Let’s look at six fairly common medical conditions and the birth control methods that are best for each.
1. Painful or heavy periods
Good methods: All hormonal methods, especially the hormonal IUD, the implant, and the shot.
Painful or heavy periods are—unfortunately—pretty common. About one in five U.S. women have menorrhagia. All types of hormonal birth control will decrease or eliminate monthly bleeding, including the pill, patch, ring, shot, implant and hormonal IUD. For women with conditions that can cause heavy bleeding (endometriosis, adenomyosis, or uterine fibroids), hormonal methods can help make periods shorter, lighter, and less painful. Decreasing or stopping monthly bleeding is also a great treatment to improve anemia (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia) and bleeding disorders (e.g. factor V deficiency).
2. Irregular periods
Good methods: The pill, the patch, and the ring.
For women with irregular periods who would prefer a more predictable cycle, the pill, patch, and ring can help regulate periods. Medical conditions that can cause an irregular cycle include poly cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and thyroid disorders.
3. Obesity
Good methods: Any and all, except emergency contraception pills.
Over one in three adult women in the U.S. are considered obese.
We’ve written about birth control and weight before.
Nearly all forms of birth control are effective for women regardless of weight.
The one important exception is emergency contraception (EC).
Research shows that levonorgestrel EC (like Plan B and Next Choice) and ella are less effective for obese women.
How much less effective?
For these women, taking an EC pill is the same as doing nothing.
However, there is an EC that works for women of any weight: the copper IUD.
It’s the most effective form of EC—including for women who aren't obese.
4. Diabetes
Good methods: Depends on your health, but nearly always includes progestin-only options like the implant, hormonal IUDs, or mini pills.
About one in ten adult women in the U.S. have diabetes, although it’s estimated that half don’t know it.
For women who have diabetes without other complications like heart, circulatory system, eye or kidney diseases, the good news is that they can safely use all types of birth control.
Diabetic women who do have any of those additional conditions need to talk with their doctors about their options, which will usually include the implant, IUDs, or progestin-only mini pills.
5. High blood pressure
Good methods: Depending on risk factors, estrogen-free methods might be best.
Relatively few women under age 30 have high blood pressure—only about one in 50.
But of those women who do, many don’t know about their condition.
It’s important to get an annual exam and have your blood pressure measured before you choose a method of birth control.
High blood pressure can increase the risk of a blood clot when using the pill, the patch, or the ring.
Women who know about their high blood pressure can manage it through a variety of tactics, including medication. Women with well-controlled blood pressure should be able to safely use the pill, the patch, or the ring. However, women who have other risk factors for blood clots like smoking or obesity should talk to a doctor about options that do not contain the hormone estrogen.
6. Breast cancer
Good methods: Non-hormonal options like the copper IUD and condoms.
Breast cancer is rare in women under age 30, with less than one in 1,500 affected. But current or past breast cancer means that a woman should avoid all hormonal methods of contraception. The non-hormonal IUD is a highly effective and safe option in these cases, and condoms are the most effective of the barrier methods.
Looking for something else?
We couldn’t tackle every health condition here, so if there’s one you'd like to see us cover in the future, let us know below!
Whatever it may be, it's likely that there is a safe and effective birth control for you.
And as always, talk to your health care provider about what's best for you.

Some health care providers with out-of-date information refuse to give young women or women without children an IUD for fear of STIs and PID. As we’ve pointed out before, science tells us that this is just plain wrong: women can safely use an IUD regardless of age or how many babies they’ve had.
How did we get here?
IUDs got a bad rap back in the 1970s when a poorly designed IUD called the Dalkon Shield caused PID for some women and failed to prevent pregnancies for others.
The Dalkon Shield made women more vulnerable to infections of the uterus, and a few women using it died from severe infections.
The makers of the Dalkon Shield didn't test it for safety and effectiveness the way we now test IUDs.
Thousands of women filed lawsuits against the makers and they went bankrupt—and their IUD has not been sold in the U.S. for almost 40 years.
The Dalkon Shield earned its bad reputation, but other IUDs have not. The IUDs currently available in the U.S.—progestin IUDs Mirena, Skyla, and Liletta and non-hormonal IUD ParaGard—have been extensively tested for safety and effectiveness. All types of IUDs have been studied for years by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Large studies have definitively proven that modern IUDs do not cause PID.
Where do STIs fit into this story?
Here’s what does cause PID: STIs. The most common STIs in the U.S. are Chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Whether a woman gets an STI depends on her sexual partners and whether they use condoms—which are still the champ for preventing STIs (and, by extension, PID). We now know that women using modern IUDs are no more likely to get an STI or PID than women using other types of birth control.
Getting an IUD soon? GYT. If a woman has an undiagnosed STI at the time an IUD is placed in the uterus, she is at a higher risk of getting PID. This is why health care providers often require that you take an STI test before getting one. This is especially likely if you are under age 26, have a new sexual partner, or have multiple partners—because all these groups are at higher risk of having an STI.
Highway out of the danger zone. About 20 days after having an IUD inserted, a woman is past the danger zone for developing PID from an STI she didn’t know she had during the insertion. After that time, PID happens at the same rate for women using IUDs as for those using other methods of birth control (aside from condoms).
But I’ve already been tested, doc. New research shows that women can safely be tested for STIs on the day an IUD is placed. For the few women who discover that they have an STI when the test results come back, they can take antibiotics to cure the infection and leave the IUD in place. Women with one exclusive sexual partner who have already been tested and cleared may even be able to get an IUD without STI screening.
Methods with benefits. There is even some evidence that the hormonal IUD (Mirena) protects against PID over time. Researchers think this might be because this IUD works by thickening cervical mucus, which makes it difficult for sperm—or an STI—to enter the uterus.
What happens if you do get an STI once you have an IUD?
STIs happen. If a woman using an IUD does get an STI, she can safely leave the IUD in place while getting treated. Even a woman who develops PID may be able to leave the IUD in place during treatment—although this is definitely something she’d want to consult a health care provider about.
Why are some people still worried about IUDs?
The short answer is that things change slowly. Doctors and nurses who were working in the 1970s and 80s still remember the bad rap of the Dalkon Shield. In those decades, influential medical organizations said IUDs were not safe. Younger doctors and nurses were taught to have the same concerns. It wasn’t until the 1990s and 2000s that we had conclusive information about the safety of IUDs, and it has only been in the last few years that medical organizations have updated their information. So this newer information about the safety of IUDs just hasn’t reached all health care providers yet. The same is true for friends, family, and the internet.
